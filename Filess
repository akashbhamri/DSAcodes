Got it. Here's how to distinguish the two statements more clearly and professionally:

1. Pipeline Implementation Statement
"We have developed a pipeline to capture thread and heap dumps of the Java process. This pipeline ensures that comprehensive diagnostic data is available for vendor analysis, enabling detailed troubleshooting and issue resolution."


2. Observation on CPU Utilization
"An analysis of CPU and process metrics from May 2024 to the present indicates a significant increase in CPU utilization on the database server. This spike in resource usage coincides with the uDeploy upgrade, suggesting a potential link between the upgrade and the observed performance trend. Further analysis is recommended to validate this correlation and address any underlying issues."



These statements separate the technical implementation and the observed impact in a professional tone.



Hereâ€™s the refined statement incorporating the SQL query:


---

"After implementing a pipeline to capture thread and heap dumps for Java processes, we analyzed CPU and process metrics from May 2024 to date. The analysis revealed a significant increase in CPU utilization on the database server following the uDeploy upgrade. Further investigation points to an SQL query introduced post-upgrade as a likely contributor to this spike. We recommend a detailed review of the query's execution plan and optimization to mitigate the performance impact."
