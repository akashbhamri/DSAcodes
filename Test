Given your requirements, here's an enhanced subject line for the alert:

"Alert: Branch Permission Updated by [Author] for Project [Project Name] - User: [User], Matcher: [Matcher]"

This subject includes all the key details (author, user, matcher, and project name) to make the alert clear and informative.

Let me know if you need help extracting these fields or setting up the alert in Splunk!
