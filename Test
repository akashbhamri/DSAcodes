Subject: Clarification on Authentication Source for Git and SSH Operations

Body:

Dear [Vendor Name/Support Team],

We need your assistance in determining which authentication method is being used in our current setup. Specifically, we would like to confirm:

1. Are all Git operations and user authentications (both UI and SSH) being processed through LDAP, or has the integration with Okta taken over these operations?


2. Is there a way to clearly identify whether SSH traffic and authentication requests are being handled by LDAP or Okta?


3. Could you guide us on any logs or configurations within Bitbucket that would help us verify this?



Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
