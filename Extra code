You could describe the migration as follows:

"We are transitioning from SAN to NAS to streamline data synchronization between our production and disaster recovery (DR) environments. This change will enable easier, more efficient replication of data across both environments. Additionally, we are planning to implement a high-availability (HA) setup for our Nexus production environment in the near future to ensure greater system resilience and uptime."

This phrasing highlights the key goals of the migration (data sync and future HA setup) in a clear and concise way.
