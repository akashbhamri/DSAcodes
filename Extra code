The best approach depends on your specific needs, but here's a recommendation based on common use cases:

1. Use values() with stats (Option 2):
If you have a large number of distinct repositories and you want to ensure all repositories are captured for each hour, using values() will help you retrieve all the unique repositories per time span without the data being truncated. This is particularly useful if you're interested in tracking which repositories were accessed, rather than counting the frequency.

index=syf_apps source="/appbin/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket/log/*" "SSH"
| rex field=_raw "git-upload-pack '(?<repo>[^']+)'"
| bucket _time span=1h
| stats values(repo) as repos by _time
| xyseries _time repos count


2. Use table before xyseries (Option 3):
If your main concern is truncation and ensuring the data is in a manageable format before visualization, using table to check the raw data first can be a great way to spot issues. Then, you can proceed with xyseries for your final output.

index=syf_apps source="/appbin/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket/log/*" "SSH"
| rex field=_raw "git-upload-pack '(?<repo>[^']+)'"
| bucket _time span=1h
| stats count by _time, repo
| table _time, repo, count
| xyseries _time repo count



Recommendation: If your goal is to visualize repository access over time (as it seems from your query), using values() with stats (Option 2) will be the best as it will give you a comprehensive view of the repositories accessed per time span.

If the number of repositories is relatively small and you're just concerned about the accuracy of the count, then table (Option 3) before xyseries can help ensure that all data is intact before creating the visualization.
