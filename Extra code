Certainly! Hereâ€™s a clearer version of your Jira description:

Description:

We need to enable the following configurations in the production environment:

TTL (Time to Live): This setting controls how long data or sessions are retained in the system before being automatically expired. Enabling TTL ensures that outdated data does not consume resources.

TTI (Time to Integration): This setting ensures that data is processed and integrated within the system in a timely manner. Enabling TTI will improve data flow and reduce delays in integration.


Action Plan:

1. Review the current production configuration to ensure compatibility with TTL and TTI settings.


2. Enable TTL and TTI in the production environment as per the guidelines.


3. Perform testing in a staging environment to validate the changes before deployment.


4. Monitor system performance post-deployment to ensure there are no issues.



Please prioritize this task and provide updates on the progress.
