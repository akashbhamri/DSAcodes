You're correct; it isn't a resolution. Let me revise it accordingly:

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Issue: High CPU utilization observed on the VM due to the execution of a multibranch pipeline and its associated downstream job.

Root Cause:

The multibranch pipeline was triggered, and during the PR build, it ran for approximately 2 hours.

The downstream job for Sonar validation was also triggered on the same VM, further increasing CPU utilization.

The application team confirmed there were no issues from their end, and the time taken was within expected norms.


Observation:

Once the process was completed, CPU utilization returned to normal.

There was no observed impact on the VM during the high utilization period.


Next Steps:

Monitor resource utilization during builds.

Consider optimizing job scheduling or balancing workloads across multiple VMs to avoid spikes in CPU usage.
