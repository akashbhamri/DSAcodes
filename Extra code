Hi Team,

Could you please ensure that we receive prior email notifications regarding patching activities on weekdays going forward? These servers are critical, and it is essential to avoid any downtime without informing the application team in advance. A proper notification schedule on weekdays would be greatly appreciated to ensure smooth coordination.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
