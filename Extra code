1. Initial Investigation
We logged into the server and used the grep command to check for the Bitbucket Java process, and found that it was not running. This indicated that the Bitbucket service might be down or experiencing issues.

2. New Relic Investigation
Next, we checked New Relic for metrics related to the systemâ€™s CPU and memory utilization, which appeared to be normal, suggesting that there were no immediate resource constraints causing the issue.

3. Escalation
Since the Bitbucket Java process is managed by the Platform team, we reached out to them for a deeper investigation and to resolve the issue.
