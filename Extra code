To address the connection pool limit and its potential impact on Bitbucket, hereâ€™s an alternative way to phrase it:

"The DB team has configured the connection pool limit to the default value of 32,767, which seems significantly high. Should we assess whether any corresponding configurations in Bitbucket, such as connection pool settings, need to be optimized to handle this limit efficiently? Please advise on any necessary adjustments to ensure seamless performance."

This phrasing keeps the concern concise and highlights the need for alignment between the database and Bitbucket settings.
