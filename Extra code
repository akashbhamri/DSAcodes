A database indexing rebuild job was scheduled daily at 9 PM EST. However, its duration was significantly longer on February 3rd (30 minutes) and February 4th (1 hour) compared to other days when it completed successfully. Due to this prolonged execution, database connection errors were observed in the logs. The team is actively collaborating with the database team to analyze the root cause and implement measures to prevent this issue in the future.
