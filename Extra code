It sounds like there might be some confusion or miscommunication, especially if the query ran recently (on 18th Jan), and yet no history is available. In this case, you can rephrase your request to emphasize the importance of understanding the query’s execution timeline, especially since it was clearly executed on the 18th of January. You might ask something like this:

Updated Request to DB Team:

"I understand that the SQL query with ID g234fws98gsc ran on the 18th of January, but I’m concerned that there is no historical data available for its earlier executions. Can you confirm whether there are any records or logs that show when the query first began executing on the server (vplrlctadbda02)? Specifically, I'm asking for the earliest available execution date and the activity pattern, as it seems odd that the history isn’t recorded for such recent activity."

This clarifies that you're aware the query ran recently and emphasizes the need to look for any potential data that could explain its earlier executions. It also puts the onus on the team to check further for any logs or records they might have missed.
