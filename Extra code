Hi Praneeth,

Kindly retain the NP account access for the resource mentioned below. We have a patching activity scheduled for this coming Saturday. Currently, the resource does not have access to Stonebranch, and a proper KT session for Stonebranch has not been scheduled yet.

Additionally, is it possible to provide at least my access to this account later? I need to log in to the server in case of any alert triggers for investigation and related activities.

This serves as a justification for maintaining the NP account access for now.
