Subject: Request for Guidance on Increasing Swap Space on Nexus Production Server

Description:

We are observing high swap usage on our Nexus production server, with the current configuration as follows:

Total Swap Space: 7.9 GB

Used Swap Space: 7.5 GB

Free Swap Space: 408 MB


The swap space is being rapidly consumed, and we are concerned about the potential impact on system performance and stability. We are considering increasing the swap space by an additional 4 GB to address this issue.

Support Bundle: Attached is the support bundle for your review.

Request:

Could you please advise on the following:

1. Is it advisable to increase the swap space by 4 GB in this situation?


2. Are there any other recommendations or best practices to manage swap usage effectively?



Your guidance will help us ensure that the server remains stable and performs optimally.

Thank you for your assistance.
