Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Problem Summary

The application encountered a transient database connection issue, resulting in the error:
java.sql.SQLTransientConnectionException: Connection is not available, request timed out after 1500ms.

The issue was specific to Bitbucket services.


Possible Root Causes

1. Connection Pool Exhaustion

All available database connections in the HikariCP pool were in use.

Potential reasons: high traffic, connection leaks, or long-running queries.



2. Database Resource Limitation

Database server reached its maximum connection limit or faced high resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).



3. Network Issues

Temporary network interruptions between the application and the database.



4. Bitbucket Backend Issue

A known issue or misconfiguration on the Bitbucket side impacting connection handling.





---

Recommendations

1. Connection Pool Optimization

Increase maximumPoolSize in HikariCP temporarily if needed.

Implement monitoring for connection usage and long-running queries.



2. Database Resource Monitoring

Ensure the database has sufficient capacity to handle peak traffic.

Monitor database health metrics like active connections, CPU, and I/O usage.



3. Network Reliability Checks

Perform periodic checks on the network connectivity between the application and the database.



4. Bitbucket Vendor Collaboration

Work closely with the Bitbucket vendor to resolve backend issues and identify improvements.





---

Follow-Up Actions

1. Post-Incident Review

Conduct a post-mortem with all stakeholders, including the Bitbucket vendor, to finalize the root cause and preventive measures.



2. Documentation Update

Update SOPs with steps to analyze and escalate similar database connection issues.



3. Long-Term Improvements

Implement connection leak detection and timeout settings in the application.

Monitor and scale database resources proactively based on usage trends.
