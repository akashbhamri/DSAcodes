Hi, can you help us understand how this server went into auto-patch mode without a stop and start script or a request to auto-patch? On Saturday, we faced an issue where the server showed as auto-patched, but our team hadn’t brought the service back up, thinking it would restart automatically. We’d like to determine how this happened and why the service didn’t resume on its own."
