Subject: Assistance Required with LDAP Authentication and Caching Mechanism

We are currently using the SVC RLCT service to authenticate users within our application. However, we have encountered an issue where multiple users attempting to access the application simultaneously are triggering frequent LDAP authentication calls. This has led to performance concerns and potential bottlenecks in the authentication process.

To address this, we have implemented a caching mechanism to validate user credentials and reduce the load on LDAP. However, we would like your assistance in reviewing the implementation to ensure its efficiency, reliability, and compliance with best practices.

Please let us know a suitable time to discuss this further or any additional details you require.

Looking forward to your expert guidance.
