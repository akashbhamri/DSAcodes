During my recent discussion with the ecom-ui team, we identified that the high memory and CPU utilization alerts are triggered when merging code into the develop branch. This happens because the system checks the compatibility of all active pull requests (PRs) with the latest version of develop, causing all checks to run simultaneously on the same executor.

To mitigate this issue and avoid overloading a single server, would it be possible to reduce the executor count from 8 to 4? By doing so, the PRs could be distributed across multiple servers, balancing the load and preventing high resource utilization on any single server at once.
