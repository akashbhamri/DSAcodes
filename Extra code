1. Alert Received and Initial Data Collection
Upon receiving the alert, we first gathered the port details associated with the service to narrow down our investigation.

2. New Relic Investigation
We then logged into New Relic and used the port details to check the restart count of the service. We also reviewed the CPU and memory utilization metrics. Our findings showed that there was high memory utilization within the pods.

3. Deeper Investigation and Escalation
Given the high memory utilization, we identified the need for a more in-depth investigation. We provided the Platform team with the details of the affected pods where high utilization was observed. Since the Platform team has the necessary access to view inner logs and more detailed metrics, we have escalated the issue to them for further analysis and to determine the root cause of the high memory usage.
