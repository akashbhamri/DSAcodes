Hereâ€™s a refined version of your statement with a professional tone and clearer phrasing:

Between 1:19 PM and 1:23 PM IST, a utilization alert was triggered due to a sudden spike in CPU usage caused by multiple Oracle processes initiated by the grid user. Once these processes completed, the CPU utilization returned to normal levels. We will coordinate with the Oracle team to investigate this issue further, focusing on ways to prevent such parallel triggers of multiple processes in the future. If necessary, we will evaluate whether to increase server resources to handle such scenarios more efficiently.
