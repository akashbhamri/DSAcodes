As of now, we haven't received any noticeable impact, but below are the possible impacts of HikariCP pool exhaustion, and we have already reached out to the vendor regarding this:

1. Failed Operations: Requests from the application to Bitbucket (e.g., pushing code, fetching repositories) may fail due to database connection unavailability.


2. Timeouts: Operations might experience delays or timeouts as connections remain blocked, affecting the overall functionality.


3. Performance Degradation: The application interacting with Bitbucket could experience slow performance or become unresponsive due to blocked database connections.



We are actively monitoring the situation and awaiting further guidance from the vendor.
