Subject: Request for Additional Resources for Monitoring and Weekend Patching Support

Dear Niraj,

I hope you're doing well. At the moment, we have only 4 resources available for monitoring, and managing 24/7 coverage has become increasingly difficult. Two of our team members are on extended leave, which has further impacted our capacity.

To ensure smooth operations, especially with ongoing monitoring and the upcoming weekend patching activities, I kindly request you allocate two resources from the run team to assist us until our team members return.

Your support during this time would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
