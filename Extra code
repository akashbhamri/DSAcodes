1. Initial Investigation
We logged into the CI system and discovered that the worker node was in an offline state, which likely contributed to the issue.

2. New Relic Investigation
Next, we accessed New Relic to analyze the CPU utilization and other relevant metrics for the affected system. The metrics appeared to be within normal ranges, indicating that resource utilization was not an immediate concern.

3. Access Limitations
Since we do not have the necessary access to perform a deeper investigation or to resolve the issue at this stage, we have escalated the matter.

4. Corrective Action
We have reached out to the Platform team for a more detailed investigation and to take appropriate corrective actions to bring the worker node back online.
