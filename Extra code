Hereâ€™s the revised version aligning with the intent:

"The patching window for the slave Python server vdlrlctapda18 is still scheduled for Friday, whereas all other servers have already been aligned to the weekend schedule. A request to update the patching window for this server (vdlrlctapda18) to match the weekend schedule was raised on 04/11/24 but is still pending approval. I will follow up with the Unix team to expedite the process.
Proposed Change for Asset Name: vdlrlctapda18 - CHG0741444"
