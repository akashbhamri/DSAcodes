"Jira has been created to track the testing of rate limiting enablement in the dev environment. If everything works fine, we will proceed to enable it in prod.

Rate Limiting is a technique used to control the number of API requests a client can make within a specific time frame. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and maintains system stability by protecting the backend from being overwhelmed by too many requests."
