Hereâ€™s a revised way to phrase it more professionally:

"Hi Praneeth,
The team has requested SVP approval to exclude this server from the upcoming patching cycle. Could you please confirm if it would be feasible to perform the upgrade after the patching is completed? Alternatively, we can draft an email to the SVP requesting formal approval for the exclusion. Please advise on the preferred course of action."
