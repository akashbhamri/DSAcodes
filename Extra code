1. Initial Investigation
We received a New Relic alert indicating high CPU and memory utilization. This prompted an immediate investigation to determine the root cause of the resource spike.

2. Server Investigation
Upon logging into the server, we identified that the Java process was consuming unusually high CPU and memory resources. We began to drill down further to understand the source of the issue.

3. New Relic Investigation
Using New Relic metrics, we monitored the CPU and memory utilization of the Java process in real-time. This allowed us to confirm the resource consumption levels and track the current stage of the process.

4. Corrective Action
Through further investigation, we traced the high resource utilization to a Jenkins pipeline that was running on the server. We took immediate action to optimize the pipeline and reduce the load. Simultaneously, we continued monitoring New Relic metrics to ensure the issue was resolved and that resource consumption returned to normal levels.
