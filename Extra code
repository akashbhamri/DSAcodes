Initial Finding
We logged into the server and used the top command to monitor processes consuming high CPU utilization. We identified that a CloudBees CI pipeline process was responsible for the high usage, though it appeared to be functioning normally.

New Relic Investigation
In New Relic, we observed a spike in CPU utilization for the CloudBees CI pipeline process, which returned to normal levels after approximately 15 minutes. This confirmed that the high usage was temporary and aligned with the pipeline's expected performance.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
The CloudBees CI pipeline process requires 15 to 30 minutes to complete under normal operation, during which it temporarily increases CPU utilization. This processing time is necessary and does not impact the virtual machineâ€™s overall performance once it completes.

Suggested Solution
To prevent unnecessary alerts during regular processing, we suggest increasing the alert threshold in New Relic from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. This adjustment will accommodate the expected duration of the pipeline process without triggering unnecessary alerts.
