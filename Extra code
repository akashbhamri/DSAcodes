Subject: Issue with HEC URL: Data Not Sending from Controller to Splunk

Description:

We are encountering an issue where data is not being sent from our controller to Splunk, despite providing the correct HEC URL in our configuration.

Here are the details:

The HEC URL has been verified and is correct.

However, no data is being transmitted from the controller to Splunk.

We need assistance in identifying the current source configuration path to help connect CloudBees CI to Splunk and ensure the data is sent correctly.


Please investigate this issue and help us resolve the connectivity between the controller and Splunk.

Thank you.
