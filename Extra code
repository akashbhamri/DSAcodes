Key Points Covered:
1. Introduction to New Relic:
Covered New Relic as a comprehensive tool for tracking application and infrastructure performance.
Discussed how it provides real-time insights to ensure system reliability and efficiency.
2. Dashboards for Different Environments:
Explained how custom dashboards are created for Production, Development, and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments.
Covered how these dashboards display critical metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, and container health.
Discussed the use of Synthetic Monitoring to track uptime and availability.
3. Configured Alerts in New Relic:
Covered the configuration of alerts, including:
CPU and Memory Alerts: Set for thresholds of 85%-90% utilization.
Filesystem Alerts: Monitoring disk space usage to avoid over-utilization.
Synthetic Alerts: Tracking the uptime of DevOps tools, Docker services, and server accessibility.
Container Alerts: Monitoring container health and service availability.
Explained how policies have been set up for each alert type to streamline notifications.
4. Application Performance Monitoring (APM):
Covered how APM provides insights into response times, error rates, and dependencies for applications.
Discussed how this helps proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
Covered how transaction data is visualized for easier debugging and optimization.
5. Investigating and Resolving Alerts in New Relic:
Explained how alerts are received via email and chat notifications.
Covered the process for investigating alerts using commands such as:
top: To check CPU and memory utilization.
ps -eaf | grep <process_name>: To identify processes causing high utilization.
Explained how Synthetic Alerts help monitor server accessibility and login failures.
6. Splunk Alerts and Log Investigation:
Covered how Splunk Alerts are triggered based on defined search queries and thresholds.
Explained how to check logs in Splunk using the Search & Reporting app.
Shared common Splunk commands for log investigation:
index="your_index" | head 10: Displays the first 10 logs.
index="your_index" status="ERROR": Filters logs for specific status like errors.
index="your_index" | stats count by host: Aggregates logs by host.
index="your_index" | regex message="error.*": Uses regular expressions to find logs with specific patterns.
Explained the investigation process of logs, focusing on filtering by time, severity, and host.
7. Policy and Investigation Alerts:
Covered the management of policies for alerts in both New Relic and Splunk.
Explained how each alert type is mapped to specific policies for easy management.
Discussed how to ensure effective investigation of alerts based on performance metrics (e.g., CPU, memory) and log review.
Action Items:
Review New Relic and Splunk alert setups to ensure thresholds are correctly configured.
Ensure team members are familiar with NRQL query examples for container health and Splunk search queries for log investigation.
Share links to policies for easy access and management of New Relic and Splunk alerts.
Next Steps:
Pranneth, let me know if I have covered everything related to New Relic and Splunk monitoring, alerts, and investigation, or if there are any additional topics we need to address.
