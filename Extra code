We received an alert because Jenkins was unable to establish a connection to the location configured in New Relic. Despite the location being operational, the alert persisted due to an inability to successfully ping the configured URL. To resolve this, we informed the New Relic team, and they reconfigured the location to one where the URL could respond successfully. Following this change, the alerts stopped, and the issue was resolved. We are now monitoring the URL to ensure no future connection issues occur and will address any similar incidents promptly.
