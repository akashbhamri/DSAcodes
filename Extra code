During the alert period, we observed a significant increase in memory usage on the 03 server, with three Java processes consuming considerable resources. Multiple alerts were triggered, including one indicating a node down event. Could you please investigate if this node experienced any issues or disconnections at that time? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide insights into the activities of these Java processes and clarify what might have triggered them during this period."
