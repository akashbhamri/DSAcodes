On August 11, 2024, the team completed a Java remediation activity in the Bitbucket development environment, successfully upgrading the Java version from 11.0.24 to 11.0.25. However, the Java version upgrade was not applied in the UDeploy agent's files, including the installed.directory, agent executable, and agent configuration file. As a result, the UDeploy agent could not detect the updated Java version and subsequently failed to start. After addressing this by upgrading the Java version in the relevant agent files, the agent was brought back online, resolving the issue effectively.
