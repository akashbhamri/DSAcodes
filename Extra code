Subject: Follow-up on High Utilization Issue Caused by KCOV Process

Hi Vinod,

As discussed during our call, we observed that the KCOV process took unusually high utilization in the pipeline. It appears this process is running as root because it is executed within a Docker container. This issue caused significant resource consumption, ultimately resulting in both VMs crashing.

Could you please investigate and provide an update on how we can avoid this issue in the future? Additionally, we would appreciate any recommendations or best practices to ensure such processes do not impact system stability.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
