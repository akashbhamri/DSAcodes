Initial Findings:
Logged into the server to verify Docker status using systemctl status docker.socket.
Confirmed that the Docker socket is up and running without issues.
New Relic Investigation:
Checked server utilization in New Relic, which appeared to be within normal limits.
Noticed that New Relic was not correctly monitoring the Docker process on this server.
Upon investigation, found that the YAML path configured in New Relic for monitoring the Docker process was incorrect.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA):
The monitoring issue in New Relic was due to an incorrect YAML path set on their end, which prevented accurate tracking of the Docker process on the server.
We have reached out to New Relic to request a correction of the YAML path to ensure proper monitoring.
