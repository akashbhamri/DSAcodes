It slipped my mind, but in our previous conversation, I had retrieved the blob data and started the cleanup process. With Pranneth’s confirmation, I deleted blobs older than two years. I paused the cleanup when the usage dropped to 78% and asked for further confirmation. Since then, I haven’t touched it.
