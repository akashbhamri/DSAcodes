Hi Srikanath,

I have successfully added the property and restarted the Bitbucket Dev service. Please proceed with further validation from the platform team's side in the Bitbucket Dev environment. Once confirmed, you can replicate the changes in the production environment to ensure the issue is resolved.

Praneeth,
After thorough research and discussions with the vendor, it was confirmed that there is no mechanism to verify whether the system authenticates using LDAP or retrieves data from the cache following the property addition. We recommend monitoring the application's performance, and if the Hikari pool issue occurs again, we can coordinate further with the vendor.

The TTL and TTI values were referred from the official Atlassian Confluence documentation. Please let us know if any adjustments are required.
