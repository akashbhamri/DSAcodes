We raised an incident with the New Relic (NR) team regarding an issue where the database (DB) was triggering an "inaccessible" alert. Upon investigation, the NR team identified that a command was missing in the NR agent running on the DB server. This missing command was preventing NR from correctly retrieving accessible data from the database. The team corrected the configuration by adding the missing statement, and they have confirmed that the data is now being fetched accurately.
