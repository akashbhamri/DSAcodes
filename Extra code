Initial Finding
We accessed the server and used df -Th to check disk utilization. The appdata directory was found to be consuming a high amount of space, which is triggering utilization alerts.

Cause
Within the appdata directory, the workspace folder was identified as the primary source of high utilization. The data stored here appears to be accumulating without recent cleanup, leading to increased storage us

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
The high utilization in the appdata directory is due to the accumulation of files in the workspace subdirectory. Since appdata cleanup automation is not yet in place, temporary manual intervention is required to prevent further utilization alerts.

Permission
As we are currently in a freeze period, we have requested permission from the client to manually clean up the appdata directory in production server. With approval, we will proceed by running the necessary cleanup commands manually to manage the high utilization until an automation script is available.
