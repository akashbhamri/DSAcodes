Here are the 5 most important questions to ask the vendor regarding SSH export traffic:

1. How can we track which repositories, users, or CI/CD jobs are generating high SSH Export traffic?


2. Is there a way to get detailed logs or reports on SSH Export activity, including timestamps and IP addresses?


3. Can we differentiate between scheduled builds and manual SSH Exports in Bitbucket?


4. Would switching to webhooks reduce SSH traffic, and how can we implement it effectively?


5. Are there any tools or plugins in Bitbucket to monitor and control SSH Export usage?
