Here's the revised update incorporating your input:

Update on TTL and TTI Properties Configuration:

We have successfully added the auth.cache.ttl and auth.cache.tti properties to the Bitbucket test environment and restarted the application without any issues. These properties are configured as follows:

auth.cache.ttl=300: Authentication cache entries remain valid for up to 5 minutes.

auth.cache.tti=10: Cache entries will expire if they remain idle for more than 10 seconds.


We are currently in the process of finding a way to validate these settings and are working with the vendor for guidance and confirmation.
