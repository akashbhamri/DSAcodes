Here are some questions to consider before enabling SSH authentication in your Okta-integrated Bitbucket setup:

1. LDAP Dependency:

Will SSH authentication in Bitbucket still query LDAP for user status (e.g., isUserActive) even after integration with Okta?

How does Okta influence or bypass the LDAP checks, if at all?



2. Authentication Flow:

If LDAP is bypassed, what is the exact system or mechanism handling user authentication for SSH connections?

Is there any fallback to LDAP in case of Okta-related issues?



3. Caching Mechanism:

If user status is still validated via LDAP, does Bitbucket cache the authentication results?

Where is this cache stored, and how long is its Time-to-Live (TTL)?

What happens when the cache expires? Will it automatically refresh by querying LDAP or Okta?
