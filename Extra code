 Short Description:

Extended Index Rebuild Causing Database Connection Failures and System Slowness

Description:

The scheduled database indexing rebuild job, which runs daily at 9 PM EST, experienced unusually long execution times on February 3rd (1 hour) and February 4th (3 hours), whereas it typically completes much faster. This prolonged execution led to database connection failures, as observed in the logs, and also caused slowness in Bitbucket URLs and other operations. Given the significant impact on system performance and availability, we request the DB team to investigate the root cause and recommend corrective actions to prevent such occurrences in the future.
