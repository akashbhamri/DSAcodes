Subject: Request to Check and Release Port Conflict with Nexus Java Process

Hi Team,

I’ve identified that port 8089 is currently being used by a Nexus Java process. This port is required for Splunk, and its current usage by Nexus is causing issues with data loading in Splunk.

Could you please investigate and confirm the purpose of this port in the Nexus application? If the port is not essential or can be reconfigured, we request it to be released for Splunk usage.

To assist in troubleshooting, here’s what has been identified so far:

Process ID: 150606

Associated Application: Nexus

Port Details: Listening on 8089


If needed, I can provide logs or assist further in identifying the service bound to this port.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
