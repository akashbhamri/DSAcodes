On November 8, 2024, the team performed a Java remediation activity in the Bitbucket development environment, upgrading the Java version from 11.0.24 to 11.0.25. However, the Java version update was missed in the UDeploy agent files, including the installed.directory, agent executable, and agent configuration file. This prevented the agent from recognizing the updated Java version, causing it to fail to start. Once the Java version was updated in the agent files, the agent came back online, and the issue was resolved.
