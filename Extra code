Here’s a refined version:

The vendor has recommended implementing rate limiting at a global level, but we’re concerned it might cause issues for certain projects with high API usage. Instead of applying it globally, can we explore the option of setting up project-specific rate limiting?

Also, can you help us with a list of projects making higher API calls compared to others? Based on that data, we can define rate limits tailored to those projects, ensuring a balanced approach without affecting performance.

Let me know your thoughts on this.
