Action Items and Investigation Steps:
1. Initial Investigation:
Logged into the Server:

Logged into the server and used the grep command to check for the fish-eye process. It was observed that Fish Eye was not running post-patching, even though it was expected to be online automatically.
The specific command used for this check was:
bash
Copy code
ps aux | grep fish-eye
The absence of the fish-eye process indicates that it did not start as expected after patching.
Checked the Patch Logs:

Reviewed the patching logs to ensure that the patch process completed successfully and there were no errors or issues during the patching process.
Confirmed that the patches were applied successfully, with no immediate signs of failure in the log files (e.g., /var/log/yum.log, /var/log/apt/history.log).
Reviewed Auto-Restart Configuration:

Verified that the auto-reboot configuration was correctly set up in the patching process.
Ensured that the server was supposed to automatically restart after patching, but it did not come up as expected.
2. New Relic Findings:
Monitored System Utilization:

Checked New Relic for any signs of high resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) that could have caused the server to fail during the restart process.
Found that the system's resource utilization was within normal limits, and there were no spikes or performance issues reported in New Relic, indicating that high resource usage was not the cause of the server failure.
Confirmed System Health:

Verified that the server is healthy in terms of system performance. All monitored metrics in New Relic (e.g., CPU, memory, network traffic) appear to be functioning as expected, confirming that the system was not overwhelmed after the patch.
3. Immediate Actions Taken:
Platform Team Notification:
Informed the Platform Team regarding the issue with Fish Eye not restarting after patching. They are now investigating whether there is an issue with the service startup or a patch-related conflict that prevented the service from coming back online.
