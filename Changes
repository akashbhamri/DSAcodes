Subject: List of Non-Operational Databases on 02/03 Servers and Archiving Logs Update

Hi Sown,

As discussed, could you please provide a list of databases running on the 02/03 servers that are currently not operational and confirm what data is currently being stored in the archive logs for these databases?

Once the data has been reviewed, we will evaluate and provide approval to disable the archive logs where applicable.

For operational databases where backups are enabled, please ensure that archive logs remain active, as they are critical for recovery and continuity.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional details.

Best regards,
Akash
