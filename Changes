Hereâ€™s a refined and professional version of your message:

"The controller experienced an unexpected partial downtime, but it was not fully down. As a result, the restart count remains at 0, and we did not receive an alert, as alerts are triggered only when the restart count reaches 1. Additionally, there were no utilization-related issues reported for this instance. For reference, please see the snapshot below."

This version improves clarity, removes errors, and maintains a professional tone. Let me know if you want any further refinements!
