Based on the checklist shown in the image, here’s what you need to check step by step after the Daylight Saving Time (DST) change:

1️⃣ Check Timestamp Updates on All Servers

Run date (Linux) or Get-Date (Windows) to verify that servers have the correct time.

Ensure that all time zones are updated correctly.


2️⃣ Perform Server Health Check

Verify CPU, memory, and disk usage to ensure no unusual spikes.

Check if any services failed or crashed due to the time change.


3️⃣ Check Log Rotation After DST Change

Ensure logs are being written correctly without missing or duplicate entries.

Verify log rotation settings to confirm they are handling the time shift properly.


4️⃣ Validate Cron Jobs & Scheduled Scripts

Confirm that scheduled jobs (cron jobs, batch jobs) ran at the correct time.

Check if any jobs were missed or executed twice due to the DST change.


5️⃣ Verify Timestamps in Logs

Open logs and ensure timestamps reflect the correct updated time.

Look for any skipped or duplicated log entries.


6️⃣ Ensure Monitoring Dashboards Are Synced

Verify that Splunk, New Relic, or other monitoring tools are showing the correct time.

Check if alerts or reports were triggered incorrectly.


7️⃣ Confirm Batch Jobs Completion

Ensure that all batch jobs completed successfully.

Look for failures or delays caused by the time change.


8️⃣ Capture Evidence

Take screenshots or logs as proof of successful validation.

Share findings with the team and report any issues.
