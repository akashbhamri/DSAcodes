Index Data Review & Rebuild Frequency Proposal

Overview:

We have reviewed the index data from 15 to 13frb.

Elevated values were observed only on Feb 2–4, with all other days remaining within normal range.


Data Limitations:

We have limited data from the database to investigate this issue further.

Since the database is not storing query execution data, it's not possible now to investigate the root cause.

We can't involve vendor support since it falls outside their scope.


Proposal:

Change the index rebuild job from a daily schedule to a weekend-only schedule.


Expected Impact:

Daily rebuilds help maintain low fragmentation.

With a weekend-only schedule, fragmentation may accumulate during weekdays, potentially impacting query performance—especially under heavy DML activity.

It's important to note that the CM vendor is outside their scope and the DB team has not confirmed what issues may arise from changing the schedule from daily to weekly.


Next Steps:

Continue monitoring with alerts and investigate further if the issue recurs.

According to Microsoft’s SQL Server documentation, less frequent index maintenance can lead to increased fragmentation, which may degrade query performance. More details can be found here: SQL Server Index Fragmentation.

Continue monitoring with alerts and investigate further if the issue recurs.
