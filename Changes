Subject: Request for Approval to Add L2 DL to Splunk Alerts

Hi Pranweth,

Hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™d like to proceed with raising a request to include the L2 distribution list in our Splunk alert notifications. This will help ensure timely awareness and quicker resolution by the right team.

Please confirm if you're okay with me moving ahead on this.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
