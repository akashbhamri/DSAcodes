Subject: Splunk Test Alert – Admin Access Granted for Testing

Dear [Recipient's Name],

As part of our testing process, we deliberately granted admin access to validate the Splunk alert for "Global Permission Granted." The alert was successfully triggered.

RITM [Granting RITM Number]: Raised to grant the admin access for testing.

RITM [Revoking RITM Number]: Raised to revoke the granted admin access and complete the test.


Please let me know if further details are required.

Best regards,
Akash
[Your Designation]
[Your Team/Department Name]

Would you like me to modify it further or keep it more concise?
