Hereâ€™s the same information in a copyable format without table borders:

Total Alerts Received: 35
Open Alerts: -
Closed Alerts: 12
Actionable Active Alerts: 12
Removed Alerts: 6
Threshold Adjustment: After discussion, we removed the 85% threshold and now have only a 90% threshold. CPU, memory, and filesystem alerts at 85% were removed.
Other Alerts Closed: -

This should be easier to copy. Let me know if you need any tweaks!
