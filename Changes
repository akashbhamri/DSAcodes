Sure! Here's a more polished and professional version of your message:

"Hi everyone,

Going forward, the monitoring team will mute alerts only when the change reaches the implementation stage.

Reshma, please inform the team if the CBCD activity is not scheduled to proceed tomorrow so they can unmute the alert accordingly."

This version improves clarity and flow while maintaining a professional tone. Let me know if you'd like any further refinements!
