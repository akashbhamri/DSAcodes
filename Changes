Subject: Recommendation from Vendor: Increase Database Pool Size Max to 200

Hi [Client's Name],

As per the vendor's recommendation, we need to increase the Database Pool Size Max from 160 to 200 to improve handling of concurrent connections. However, we will closely monitor the system performance, and if we observe any issues related to increased load, we will adjust the value accordingly.

Please confirm if we can proceed with this change.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
