Hereâ€™s the revised version:

Hi [DB Team],

We request you to set an alert for the DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK table. On 4th February, we encountered an issue where the lock on this table was not released, causing other processes to fail in acquiring the lock.

We would like an alert to be triggered if the LOCKED value remains 1 for more than a few minutes. This will help us monitor and resolve such issues proactively.

Thank you in advance for your support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
