Initial Investigation

We have received a CPU utilization alert indicating high usage on the Java process. Upon further investigation, we identified that only the Java process is causing the high utilization.

Actions Taken

Thread & Heap Dump Collection: We collected thread and heap dumps of the Java process using the following pipeline:
(Provide pipeline details if needed)

Vendor Support: A support ticket has been raised with the vendor, attaching all relevant dumps and logs for further analysis.

Cloud Coverage Coordination: We are coordinating with the cloud coverage team to assess whether resource scaling is required, as the current instance has only 8 cores.


New Relic Investigation

Observed sustained high CPU utilization on the Java process.

No significant memory spikes or abnormal GC behavior were detected.

Other system metrics remain within normal thresholds, indicating no broader system-wide issue.


Further updates will be shared based on the ongoing investigation.
