Subject: Follow-Up on Monitoring Team's Requirements for Independent Operations

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope you are well.

Following our recent discussion with my manager, I would like to outline the requirements identified for the monitoring team to work independently. These points detail the necessary access and resource adjustments:

CloudBees CI Controller & Server:

Enable restarting access for both the controller and the server.

Provide support bundle download access for all associated tools to facilitate deep and independent analysis.


Team Expertise:

It is essential to have at least one senior team member with extensive troubleshooting experience and comprehensive knowledge of our current tools.


Access Permissions:

Ensure that all team members maintain access to the NPA account, RMPCI, and JKSlave. This is critical, especially in light of the planned revocation of these accesses from the monitoring team.


KT Access:

KT access from the build team is not required at this time.



Please review the above points and let me know if any further clarification is needed or if there are additional steps we should take. Your support in implementing these changes is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
