Subject: Request to Disable Archive Logs for 01 Database

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to request the disabling of archive logs for the 01 database, as it is currently being used exclusively for testing purposes. Since the database does not store any critical or persistent data, enabling archive logs is not required and may unnecessarily utilize resources.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any concerns regarding this request.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
