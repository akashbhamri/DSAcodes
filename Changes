Subject: Update on Bitbucket Database Connection Investigation

Hi [Client's Name],

We have engaged both the DB team and the vendor to investigate the Bitbucket database connection issue. The DB team is checking for long-running queries, locks, and performance concerns, while the vendor is analyzing potential application-level issues. Additionally, we are reviewing network and application logs to identify any anomalies related to SSH/HTTPS traffic or timeouts. We will share further updates as soon as we receive more insights. Please let us know if you need any additional details.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
