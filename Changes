Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version:

"I completely understand and agree with your concerns. However, I still need access to our VM. Ramesh, could you please guide us on how we can achieve this while adhering to the existing policies?"

This version keeps the tone respectful and collaborative while clearly stating your request. Would you like any adjustments?
