Here's a polished and professional version of your message with clear justification:

"Currently, we have access to the root CV, but it has been removed, which has created a dependency on the Unix team for accessing logs. Each time we need to investigate server-level issues, we must request logs from them, which can delay the troubleshooting process. Gaining direct access again would eliminate this dependency, streamline our investigations, and significantly improve our efficiency in identifying and resolving server-level issues."

This version clearly explains the problem, its impact, and the benefit of granting access. Would you like any adjustments?
