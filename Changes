Subject: Splunk Test Alert – Admin Access Granted for Testing

Dear [Recipient's Name],

We deliberately granted admin access as part of a test to validate if the Splunk alert for "Global Permission Granted" is triggered correctly.
The alert has been successfully received. An RITM has been raised to revoke the granted admin access and complete the test process.

Please let me know if further details are required.

Best regards,
Akash
[Your Designation]
[Your Team/Department Name]

Want it to be more technical or detailed about the permission type?
