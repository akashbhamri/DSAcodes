Index Data Review & Rebuild Frequency Proposal

Overview:

We reviewed the index data from 15 to 13frb and noticed elevated values only on Feb 2–4. All other days were within normal range.


Data Limitations:

We don't have enough database data to investigate further.

Since the database isn’t storing query execution data, we can't pinpoint the root cause.

Also, vendor support is out of scope for this issue.


Proposal:

Change the index rebuild job from a daily schedule to a weekend-only schedule.


Expected Impact:

Daily rebuilds help keep fragmentation low and ensure updated statistics.

Microsoft’s documentation on index maintenance explains that rebuilding an index resets fragmentation and updates statistics. While it doesn’t directly say that less frequent rebuilds will harm performance, it indirectly suggests that regular maintenance is important.

In environments with high DML activity, waiting until the weekend could allow fragmentation to build up during weekdays, which might affect query performance.

Please note that the CM vendor is not responsible for this, and the DB team hasn't confirmed the exact issues that might arise from changing the schedule.


Next Steps:

Continue monitoring with alerts and investigate further if the issue recurs.
