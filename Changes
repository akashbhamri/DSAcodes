Here’s a refined version:

"Preventive Action – Request for Alert Setup"
We requested the DB team to set up an alert system for long-running index rebuild jobs. This alert will notify us if the job exceeds a predefined duration, allowing us to take timely action and prevent application performance issues in the future.

Let me know if you want this more formal or detailed!
