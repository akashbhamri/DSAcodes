Subject: Request for Approval to Test Bitbucket Admin Access Alert

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I would like to seek your approval for a testing activity. The purpose of this test is to ensure that an alert is triggered in Splunk whenever admin access is granted in Bitbucket.

Once the alert is received, we will immediately revoke the admin access granted during the test.

Please let me know if you approve or need further details.

Best regards,
Akash
