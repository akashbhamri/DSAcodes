Subject: Database Connection Issues – Bitbucket Failing to Connect

Hi [DB Team],

We are facing database connection issues with Bitbucket. The logs show the following error:

org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: could not prepare statement  
SqlExceptionHelper bitbucket - Interrupted during connection acquisition

This issue occurred between March 10, 2025, 10:39 AM EST to March 11, 2025, 9:30 AM EST.

This suggests that either the database is unavailable, the network connection is unstable, or there is a long-running query holding connections for too long.

Could you please check:

1. If there are any ongoing long-running queries or locks on the database?


2. If there were any recent performance issues, high load, or restarts?


3. If the connection pool is reaching its limit due to too many active connections?



Let us know your findings so we can proceed with further troubleshooting.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
