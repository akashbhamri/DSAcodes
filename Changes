Subject: Proposal to Use Only a 90% Threshold for Alerts

Hi Praneeth,

Following our meeting yesterday, I’m proposing that we eliminate the 85% threshold and rely solely on a 90% threshold for our CPU, memory, and filesystem alerts.

Reasons for This Change:

Reduced Alert Noise:
The 85% threshold often generates alerts for minor fluctuations that don’t necessarily indicate a critical issue. Sticking with a 90% threshold will help us avoid these non-essential alerts.

Enhanced Focus on Critical Issues:
With a single threshold at 90%, we can better prioritize alerts that reflect genuinely critical resource usage, ensuring our team focuses on resolving actual performance bottlenecks.

Simplified Monitoring Configuration:
Maintaining just one threshold simplifies our monitoring setup and makes it easier to manage and adjust as needed.


Could you please share your thoughts on this approach? I’d like to ensure we’re aligned before making any changes.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
