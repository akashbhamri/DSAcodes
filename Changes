Here's a more refined version:

"No, Rahul. We used to receive over 100 alerts earlier, but we've fine-tuned them significantly. In our call, we added alerts for closing alerts, active alerts, and weekend activity, bringing the count down to around 25. However, only 6 to 8 of these are the key alerts."

This keeps it professional, concise, and clear. Let me know if you want any further adjustments!
