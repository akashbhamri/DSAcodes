Here’s the refined subject line with the project key clearly mentioned:

[Bitbucket Production] User 503014831 Updated Branch Permission for Project Key TESTA (Branch: Develop) – SSO Values: 503014669, 503014817

Let me know if you want to specify exactly what kind of update (e.g., added, modified, or removed) was done!
