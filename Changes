Here's a more polished version of your message:

"Team, the below RITM has been open since February 19th, but we haven’t received any updates yet. Could someone from the Oracle team kindly prioritize this? It’s a minor requirement and shouldn’t take much time to complete."

Would you like more variations or does this work for you?
