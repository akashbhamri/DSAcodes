We have raised an incident with the Network Team to investigate the 503 and 504 errors encountered on Bitbucket between 10:00 AM EST and 2:26 PM EST on March 19. They are reviewing potential causes, including load balancer, firewall, and network latency issues. We will share further updates once we receive their findings.
