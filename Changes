Subject: Request to Reschedule Rebuild Index Job

Hi Team,

After reviewing application metrics for the past 5 months, we have identified the following:

Response Times: Elevated response times have been observed.

Traffic Pattern: There is a notable drop in request volume around 7 PM EST.

Apdex Score: The Apdex score remains strong.


We discussed these findings with Praneet, and he has approved the proposed change. Accordingly, we will raise a request to the DB team to reschedule the rebuild index job from 9 PM EST to 7 PM EST.

Please let me know if there are any concerns or additional inputs.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
