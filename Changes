Here’s a simpler and more natural version:

"We’ve set up a comprehensive Splunk alerting system for this environment, including an alert that tracks error logs from the past two years. During this time, we collected and reviewed errors, setting up specific alerts for each issue after confirming them with the client. So far, we’ve configured over 20 alerts covering database errors, access errors, table locks, and other critical issues. This setup ensures reliable monitoring and helps us catch and resolve problems quickly to maintain system stability and performance."
