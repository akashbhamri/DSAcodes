Hereâ€™s a polished and professional version with clear justification:

"We previously had access to the root CV, but it was removed as part of the wheel group remediation. As a result, we now rely on the Unix team to share logs whenever we need to investigate server-level issues, creating a dependency that can delay the troubleshooting process. Gaining direct access to the Splunk logs for our VM's CV would eliminate this dependency, streamline investigations, and enhance our efficiency in resolving server-level issues. We are requesting access strictly for our VM's CV to maintain proper scope and compliance."

This version clearly explains the situation, the impact, and the justification for the request while maintaining a professional tone. Would you like any changes?
