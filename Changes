Hi Faisal,

We have raised the following change ticket to reschedule the index rebuild job from 9 PM EST to 7 PM EST, after internal discussions with Ashraf and Praneeth. Could you please provide your approval for this activity scheduled on February 26, 2025?

This is an online activity, so no downtime will be required.

Thank you,
