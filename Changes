Here's a refined version that focuses on your need to view the logs without root access:

"The root access has been strictly removed for everyone on the DevOps support CV as part of the policy, and we fully understand that no one should have root privileges. However, my request is solely to gain read-only access to view the logs, without requiring root access, to help investigate server-level issues more efficiently."

This version keeps the message clear and emphasizes that you're respecting the policy while requesting minimal access. Would you like any changes?
