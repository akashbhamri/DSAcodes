The RCA is still in progress. Our team is looking into the issues with the ESXi host that caused tasks to stall and several VMs to hang. We’ve temporarily restored operations by rebooting the host and rerouting traffic, but we’re still working to pinpoint the exact root cause. Thanks for your patience, and we’ll update you as soon as we have more information.



Here are different ways to convey that the VM is healthy and running without issues:

1. Formal:
"The VM is operating optimally with no reported issues or service disruptions."


2. Concise:
"The VM is stable and functioning as expected, with no impact observed."


3. Detailed:
"Health checks confirm the VM is performing well. All services are up, and no anomalies or performance issues have been detected."


4. Professional:
"The VM is in good health, and all system resources are within normal thresholds. No incidents or impacts have been reported."


5. Casual:
"The VM is running smoothly with no problems or user-reported issues."



Would you like help drafting a status report based on this?
