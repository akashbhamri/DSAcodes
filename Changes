Subject: List of Non-Operational Databases on 02/03 Servers and Archiving Logs Update

Hi Sown,

As discussed, could you please provide a list of databases running on the 02/03 servers that are currently not operational? For these databases, we can proceed with disabling the archive logs to prevent unnecessary growth in storage size.

For databases where backups are enabled, it’s important to ensure that archive logs remain active and are not disabled, as they are critical for recovery and continuity.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional details.

Best regards,
Akash
