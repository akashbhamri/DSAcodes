Subject: Resource Requirement for Enhancements in Monitoring Capabilities

Dear [Recipient's Name],

As per our discussion with Praneeth and Asharaf, they are aligned with the current roles and responsibilities of the monitoring team. However, they emphasized the need to enhance other areas, explore new tools, and elaborate on additional features.

To effectively drive these enhancements, I would require at least one resource with strong troubleshooting expertise, preferably a senior resource who can collaborate with me on this initiative. Their support would be crucial in implementing these improvements efficiently.

Please let me know how we can proceed with this request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
