The sandbox server Praneeth (vlducdapda03) is experiencing an average database response time of 0.22 seconds. This indicates that the database queries from this server are taking 220 milliseconds to complete.

However, our UCD servers are performing normally, so the issue is specific to the sandbox environment and does not impact production or deployment servers.
