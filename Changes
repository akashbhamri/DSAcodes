Here's the revised version with that detail added:

"Thank you, Purvesh and Sheetal, for setting up these alerts. We have a request to add one more alert. On 4th February, we encountered a database table lock, which prevented our other server from acquiring the lock on this table. We would like an alert to be triggered for such incidents from the database end as well."

Let me know if you want to make it more concise or formal!
