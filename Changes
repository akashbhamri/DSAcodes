Here’s the updated subject line with "Global Permission" included:

[External] Splunk Alert: Bitbucket Production – Global Permission [Access Type] Granted | Provided by [First SSO] to [Last SSO]

Example:
[External] Splunk Alert: Bitbucket Production – Global Permission Admin Access Granted | Provided by 503014831 to 503019365

Let me know if you want to adjust the word order or emphasis further!
