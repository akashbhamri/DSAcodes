Subject: Follow-Up on Monitoring Team's Requirements for Independent Operations

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope you are well.

Following our recent discussion with my manager, I would like to outline the requirements identified for the monitoring team to operate independently. The key points are as follows:

CloudBees CI Controller & Server:

Enable restarting access for both the controller and the server.

Provide support bundle download access for all associated tools to facilitate deep and independent analysis.


Team Expertise:

It is essential to have at least one senior team member with extensive troubleshooting experience and comprehensive knowledge of our current tools.


Access Permissions:

Ensure that all team members maintain access to the NPA account, RMPCI, and JKSlave. This is critical, especially considering the planned revocation of these accesses from the monitoring team.


KT Access:

KT access from the build team is not required at this time.


L2 Support Coverage:

Previously, we received support from an L2 team that notified us of emails and called us during weekends. Since that support has been removed, we request similar assistance from another L2 team to help us maintain the same level of operational support.



Thank you for your attention to these matters. Please let me know if you need any further clarification or additional information.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
