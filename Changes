Just to share some context — during the previous socket correction on vplbitbucapda07 and vplbitbucapda08, no formal implementation plan was created, as it was considered a minor change. However, as per Praneeth's recent guidance, even minor changes now require a documented plan.

So, we’ve prepared this implementation plan accordingly. The activity is scheduled for the 15th, and we need to get it approved and shared with the Cloud team 48 hours in advance.
