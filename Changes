Subject: Server Health Report & Bitbucket Incident Update

Hi Team,

I have collected the server health data across all servers and compiled it into a CSV file for review. All servers are in good health. Let me know if you need any specific insights from it.

Additionally, Bitbucket experienced degraded performance on March 19, 2025, which may have caused intermittent errors, including potential 504 Gateway Timeout issues. The incident has since been resolved. You can find more details on the official Bitbucket status page: https://bitbucket.status.atlassian.com.

If you encountered any related issues, please verify and update accordingly. Let me know if any further action is needed.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
