schedule has been updated to Saturday, as we recently changed the maintenance window timing?
Also, once the final window time is confirmed, kindly update the alert schedule accordingly.

Additionally, we have a quick question:
Is it possible to configure the alert to trigger based solely on threshold breaches (e.g., if a job exceeds the defined duration), regardless of the scheduled time? Or do we need to keep updating the schedule each time to make it work?

Looking forward to your
