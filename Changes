Hereâ€™s a more polished way to say it:

"Hi everyone, this call is to discuss the resource increase for the IAC node mentioned below. The team is experiencing high resource utilization on the following server."

This version sounds more structured and professional while keeping the meaning intact. Let me know if you'd like any tweaks!
