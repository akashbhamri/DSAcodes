Here’s a more respectful and polished version:

"Before we provide you with the frequency, we would appreciate some insights on the following:

1. What factors should we consider when determining the optimal frequency for the index rebuild job?


2. Would changing the schedule from daily to weekly have any impact on query performance?


3. Do we have monitoring in place to track index fragmentation and performance trends?



We truly appreciate your guidance on this and would be grateful for your valuable input. Thank you!"

This adds humility and acknowledges the VP’s expertise. Let me know if you’d like any further refinements!
