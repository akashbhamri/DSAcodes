Hi Faisal,

We have a planned socket configuration activity recommended by the Cloud team. The implementation plan has already been reviewed and approved by Sapna.

This activity was previously performed on servers vplbitbucapda07 and vplbitbucapda08 without any issues. As part of this change, we’ll need to reboot the servers during the activity.

Kindly provide your approval to proceed with the server reboot during the scheduled window.

Best regards,
Akash

Let me know if you'd like to include the date/time or mention the specific servers.
