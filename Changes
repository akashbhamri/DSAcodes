I am raising an RITM to set up an alert script at the CJOC (CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center) level to monitor the uptime of the controller. The script should continuously check the status of the controller, and if it goes down, it should automatically trigger an alert. The alert notifications should be sent to the designated distribution list ([DL Name]) to ensure the relevant teams are informed. Additionally, please enable PagerDuty integration so that real-time incident notifications are triggered for a faster response. If the controller remains down for an extended period, an escalation mechanism should be in place to ensure timely resolution. Please review this request and let me know if any additional details are required.
