You can ask in a more professional way:

"Was this issue observed only during the mentioned time frame, or have there been multiple occurrences between 10 AM and 2 PM? If there were multiple instances, could you provide the timestamps to help us analyze the pattern?"

This makes it clear that you're asking whether the issue was isolated or recurring.
