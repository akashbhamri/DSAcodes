Subject: Index Rebuild Job Rescheduling Proposal

Hi Team,

Following our internal discussions, we have decided not to proceed with changing the index rebuild frequency from daily to weekly. Instead, we propose rescheduling the current daily rebuild job from 9 PM EST to 7 PM EST.

Reason for Change:

The earlier start time will help minimize the impact on system performance during peak hours.

It also allows for better monitoring and issue resolution within regular support hours.


Next Steps:

Please let us know if there are any concerns or dependencies with shifting the schedule.

If there are no objections, we plan to implement the new schedule on [insert proposed date].


Thank you for your cooperation. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
