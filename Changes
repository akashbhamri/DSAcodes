You can phrase your request in different ways:

Formal Request:

"Praneeth, could you please approve this and add the required access? I need the RMP CI pass to install Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB on the test server using containerization."

Concise and Direct:

"Praneeth, can you approve this and grant access? I need the RMP CI pass for setting up monitoring tools on the test server."

Polite and Professional:

"Hi Praneeth, could you help with approving this and adding the necessary permissions? I need the RMP CI pass to proceed with containerizing Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB on the test server."

Let me know if you'd like any tweaks!
