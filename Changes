Hi Santish,

The server metrics were not reflected in New Relic on both March 15 and March 21. Here is the URL for reference.

Ubix has not identified any issues on the server side, and we haven't found any error logs on our end either. Due to this, we received a synthetic alert.

Let me know how we can proceed.
