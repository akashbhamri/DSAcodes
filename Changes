Here’s your refined checklist:

✅ APM Dashboard Checked (Reviewed app performance, response times, and errors)
✅ Utilization Dashboard Checked (Monitored CPU, memory, disk, and network usage)
✅ Workload Monitoring Checked (Checked for active alerts in Prod and Dev environments)
✅ No Critical Alerts Detected (Confirmed system stability)

This keeps it clear and to the point. Let me know if you need any changes!
