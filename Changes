Initial Investigation
Upon receiving the alert, we promptly checked the CB CI UI and observed that the system was offline. Since we do not have direct access to the logs or the ability to restart the server, we immediately notified the platform team to conduct a deeper investigation.

New Relic Investigation
In parallel, we utilized New Relic to monitor key performance metrics. We reviewed the running processes along with CPU and memory thresholds to rule out any performance-related issues. The metrics did not indicate any anomalies from a resource perspective.

Connectivity Issue Escalation
Subsequent investigations by the platform team identified a connectivity issue between CB CI and the Windows server. Based on this finding, we raised an incident, and the platform team is now working closely with the network team to resolve the issue.
