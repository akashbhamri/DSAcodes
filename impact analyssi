What are the specific goals we aim to achieve with rate limiting (e.g., reducing server load, preventing abuse)?What is the current traffic pattern and how will rate limiting affect it?What are the best practices for configuring rate limits based on our application's needs?How should we define the rate limits (e.g., requests per minute, requests per hour)?What should the bucket size be for our rate limiting setup, and how does it affect user experience and system performance?How will rate limiting impact different types of users (e.g., authenticated vs. anonymous)?What fallback mechanisms or exceptions should be in place for critical requests that need to bypass rate limits?How will we handle cases where legitimate users are unintentionally throttled?What monitoring and logging should we implement to track the effectiveness and any potential issues with rate limiting?What tools or services can we use to implement and manage rate limiting effectively?How often should we review and adjust the rate limits to ensure they remain effective and appropriate?What are the potential risks or downsides of enabling rate limiting, and how can we mitigate them?
