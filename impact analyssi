**Rate Limiting Implementation Considerations**

1. **Goals and Objectives**
   - What are the specific goals we aim to achieve with rate limiting (e.g., reducing server load, preventing abuse)?

2. **Traffic Patterns**
   - What is the current traffic pattern and how will rate limiting affect it?

3. **Configuration Best Practices**
   - What are the best practices for configuring rate limits based on our application's needs?

4. **Rate Limit Definition**
   - How should we define the rate limits (e.g., requests per minute, requests per hour)?

5. **Bucket Size**
   - What should the bucket size be for our rate limiting setup, and how does it affect user experience and system performance?

6. **User Impact**
   - How will rate limiting impact different types of users (e.g., authenticated vs. anonymous)?

7. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - What fallback mechanisms or exceptions should be in place for critical requests that need to bypass rate limits?

8. **Handling Throttling**
   - How will we handle cases where legitimate users are unintentionally throttled?

9. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - What monitoring and logging should we implement to track the effectiveness and any potential issues with rate limiting?

10. **Tools and Services**
    - What tools or services can we use to implement and manage rate limiting effectively?

11. **Review and Adjustment**
    - How often should we review and adjust the rate limits to ensure they remain effective and appropriate?

12. **Risks and Mitigation**
    - What are the potential risks or downsides of enabling rate limiting, and how can we mitigate them?
