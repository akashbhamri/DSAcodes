The issue you're facing is due to pasting HTML tags like <br><sub> into a platform that doesn't render them (like Word, Outlook, or Confluence). To fix it, you need a plain text version with properly formatted line breaks and indentations â€” no HTML.

Hereâ€™s the Word/Outlook/Confluence-friendly version of the same table with line breaks and notes already formatted clearly:

âœ… Notes:

This format avoids HTML tags and works perfectly when pasting into Microsoft Word, Outlook, Google Docs, or Confluence.

If you're pasting into Confluence, use the Insert Table option and copy each cell value from above.

If pasting into Outlook, use the format above or paste from the Word document we generated earlier.


Would you like a Confluence markdown version or a PowerPoint slide too?
