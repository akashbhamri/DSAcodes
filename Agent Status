Subject: Critical Alerts Getting Missed â€“ Request for Immediate Attention

Hi Alekhya,

Even after informing, we are still not receiving notifications from the L2 team for all alerts. Only a few resources are notifying us, while others are getting missed. Kindly let me know if there is any concern or issue the team is facing in notifying us.

All our alerts are critical, and we cannot afford to miss them. Requesting your immediate attention to resolve this at the earliest.

Thanks & Regards,
Akash Bhamri

Would you like me to make it more assertive, polite, or formal?
