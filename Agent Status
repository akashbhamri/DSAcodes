As discussed, we need to run a specific command on the server as a temporary workaround until the permanent fix is implemented.

Before we proceed, we require approval from either Asharf or Praneeth. Could you please help in reaching out to them and getting the necessary approval?

Weâ€™ll hold off on executing the command until we have their confirmation.

Appreciate your support on this.
