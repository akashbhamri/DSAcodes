Subject: Request for BTR Session â€“ Service Account Configuration

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

We require a BTR session to go over the new service account and the configurations we've done so far, as discussed. This session is important to ensure everything is in place before the scheduled patching activity this weekend.

Could you please let us know a suitable time to schedule this session?

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Thanks & Regards,
Akash Bhamri
