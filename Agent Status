Nexus Auto Blocking â€“ Explained Simply

What is it?

Auto blocking is a feature in Nexus that automatically blocks a remote repository if it's slow or not responding.


---

When Auto Blocking is ENABLED:

Nexus tries to contact a remote repo.

If it doesn't respond in 20 seconds, it tries again (3 times total).

If all 3 fail, Nexus blocks that remote.


What happens next:

Nexus stops using the blocked remote.

It checks it again later (every 10s, 20s, 30s, etc., up to 60 minutes).

Once it's working, Nexus unblocks it automatically.


Benefits:

No delay for builds or users.

Keeps Nexus fast and responsive.

Prevents server resource issues.



---

When Auto Blocking is DISABLED:

Nexus tries the slow or down remote every time.

Even after 3 failures, it does not block it.

This causes:

Long delays (up to a minute per request),

Thread exhaustion (Nexus gets overloaded),

Slower builds and system slowdowns.
