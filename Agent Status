Subject: Request for BTR Session on UDeploy HA Setup – Urgent

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

We need to schedule a BTR session for the UDeploy HA setup. We have a patching activity planned for this weekend, and to ensure everything goes smoothly, it’s important to have this session before the activity.

We also need to configure alerts as part of the setup. Considering the urgency, it would be great if you could let us know your earliest availability for the session.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks & Regards,
Akash Bhamri
