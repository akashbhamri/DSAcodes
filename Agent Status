We understand that the issue was caused by a Java process. However, since the process has completed, we are unable to identify the main and detailed logs related to it. Even the application vendor was not able to assist in this case.

In a similar issue previously, Red Hat support helped us identify which specific process or thread was triggered during the spike, which allowed us to resolve the problem effectively.

Hence, we request you to please raise a case with the Red Hat vendor as well. We've already raised a case with the application vendor, but additional insights from Red Hat could help us get to the root cause.
