As we had modified the index rebuild window earlier from 9 PM to 7 PM, could you please confirm if the alerting script was also adjusted accordingly at that time?

Additionally, to ensure we donâ€™t miss future occurrences:

Can you set up a fallback mechanism that triggers an alert in case the primary alert fails to execute?

Also, could you please explore the possibility of setting up an alert for long-running queries, not just index jobs? This would help us detect performance issues early.


Appreciate your support on this.
