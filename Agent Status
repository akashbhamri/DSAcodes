Got it! Here's a refined version tailored for raising the incident to the DBA team:


---

Short Description:
Index rebuild job ran longer than expected; alert did not trigger

Description:
The index rebuild job took longer than expected, causing performance impact. This issue had occurred earlier as well, after which the rebuild window was revised from 9 PM EST to 7 PM EST.

Although an alert was configured from the DBA side, it was not triggered during this occurrence. We are raising this incident to address both the long-running index rebuild and the alert failure. Requesting DBA team to analyze and share the root cause.
