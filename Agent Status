Absolutely! Here's your updated content section with the total alert count and removal of 85% threshold alerts clearly mentioned:


---

> 13/05/2025 – After discussion, we removed the 85% threshold and now only have a 90% threshold for CPU, memory, and filesystem alerts.

As part of this change, 50 alerts triggered at the 85% threshold were removed, reducing noise and improving alert relevance.

We are currently receiving all necessary alerts based on the 90% threshold, and no further alert adjustment is required at this stage.

Additionally, we are in the process of setting up enhanced APM monitoring alerts, which will help us monitor the tool more efficiently and proactively.

Let me know if you want to update the alert counts (like received, closed, active, etc.) as well!


Thank you for the clarification!

You're asking how to mention the change in total alert count due to removing the 85% threshold, just like in the table you shared.

Here’s how you can phrase it, formatted in the same style:


---

📌 Suggested Entry (for your alert summary):

Total Alerts Received: 12
Actionable Active Alerts: 1
Closed Alerts: 11
Removed Alerts: 50 (from 85% threshold)
Weekend Activity Alerts: 3
Remarks:

> “As part of the threshold cleanup activity, the 85% CPU/memory/filesystem alert logic was disabled. A total of 50 alerts triggered at 85% were removed. Now, only the 90% threshold is active, ensuring more relevant alerting.”

Let me know your exact alert numbers and I’ll customize this further.
