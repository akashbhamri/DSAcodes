Hi Jerrold,

Thank you for the session. Please share the document with us once it has been created for all tools.

It’s good to hear that we’ve already integrated it with UDeploy, Bitbucket, and CBCD. Kindly confirm once the setup is complete for the new server so we can plan another session covering the remaining tools.

Also, please keep us updated when we move forward with the integration process for other tools.

Great progress so far — let’s keep it going!

Best regards,
