Got it! Here's the updated version with that point included:

Hi Praneeth,

I've reviewed both the JIRA tickets, and it looks like the work on CloudBees Analytics—especially involving coordination with the vendor—would require more than 3 hours of effort daily.

Additionally, I don’t have prior experience with this tool, so I’d need to start from scratch, which would add to the time and ramp-up needed. Given that I’m currently leading the monitoring team and handling several other key responsibilities, I’m afraid I don’t have the bandwidth to take this on at the moment.

I hope you understand, and please let me know if there’s any other way I can support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
