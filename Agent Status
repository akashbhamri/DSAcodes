Subject: Clarification and Cleanup Recommendation for AO_D9E976_INVALID_LINE Table

Hi Team,

We’ve identified that the table AO_D9E976_INVALID_LINE, which is associated with the Enhanced Secret Scanner for Bitbucket by Soteri, is occupying over 245 GB in our Bitbucket database.

Could you please help us with the following:

1. What exactly is the purpose of this table? Does it store historical scan results or detected secret lines?


2. Is it safe to prune or clean up this table? If yes, could you share recommended procedures or cleanup guidelines?


3. Are there any best practices to control the growth of this table (e.g., retention policies, data purging options)?


4. Can this impact the plugin’s performance or scanning capabilities if old records are archived or deleted?



We’re looking to optimize database usage without affecting plugin functionality. Your guidance on this would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Your Team / Company Name]
