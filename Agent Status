Subject: Urgent Escalation: Pending RCA for Severity Issue Raised on 26th

Email Body:
Dear [Recipient's Name],

We raised this case on 26th June, and as you are aware, this is a critical severity issue for us, with our production tool being down. At the time of raising, we were informed that the response and RCA would be provided within 2 days. However, it has now been 5 days, and we have yet to receive any root cause or resolution update.

Given the criticality and prolonged impact on our production environment, we request you to please prioritize this case with immediate effect. We expect urgent attention and a clear timeline for the resolution and RCA.

Kindly escalate this internally and help expedite the resolution.

Looking forward to your swift response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Contact Info, if needed]
