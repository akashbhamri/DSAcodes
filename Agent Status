We are planning a critical call today at 7 PM IST, when both our leads and the DB team will be available. However, I noticed that you may not be available at that time.

Could you please let me know if anyone else from your team can support in your absence? Since this issue is critical, we would like to proceed with the call today itself.

Looking forward to your response.
