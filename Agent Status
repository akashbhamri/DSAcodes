Missed Bitbucket Alerts â€“ Request for Justification

Hi Team,

Despite having active weekend support in place, all four of you missed the Bitbucket alerts when they were triggered, and no communication was made regarding this.

Kindly provide a justification on why these alerts were not acknowledged or informed in the group.

Awaiting your response.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
