As you’re proceeding with the memory increase for the VELPW environment, we’d like to check if we can also include the CPU core upgrade (from 4 cores to 16 cores) in the same change window.

This is based on the DB team’s recommendation. To avoid any risk of downtime, please plan the upgrade in a way that 01 and PHX are handled together, and 02 is done in a separate slot—ensuring both DBs are not impacted at the same time.

Kindly confirm if the CPU upgrade can be included in the same change and share the proposed schedule.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
