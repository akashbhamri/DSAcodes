We have not observed any UI performance degradation despite memory usage exceeding 90%. As a result, we would like to understand whether this level of usage is considered acceptable. If so, we are proposing to increase the memory threshold to 95% for a duration of 15 minutes. Kindly confirm if this adjustment is appropriate


"We have not observed any UI performance degradation, even though the memory usage has been consistently exceeding the current threshold range of 90% to 95%. We would like to confirm if this level of memory utilization is acceptable. If so, we propose adjusting the alert threshold to trigger only when memory usage exceeds 95% for a sustained duration of 15 minutes. Kindly advise if this change would be appropriate."
