Subject: Enabling New Relic Browser Monitoring on Bitbucket Data Center

Message:

Hello [Vendor Contact/Team],

We’re currently working on enhancing our monitoring capabilities for our Bitbucket Data Center environment by enabling New Relic Browser Monitoring. Our goal is to have a snippet inserted into every page served by Bitbucket so that we can track real user monitoring metrics and gain deeper insights into page performance.

To achieve this, we need to integrate a small JavaScript snippet (provided by New Relic) into the Bitbucket application’s HTML (specifically into the <head> section of every page). We understand that Bitbucket Data Center does not offer a built-in “Custom HTML” option like some other Atlassian products (e.g., Jira or Confluence), and we need guidance on the best method to accomplish this in a supported and upgrade-safe manner.

We have a few questions regarding how we can move forward:

1. Environment Setup

Can you confirm that our Bitbucket instance is indeed running on Data Center, and detail any specific limitations or considerations for injecting custom code in this environment?



2. Built-In Customization

Does Bitbucket Data Center offer any native UI-based configuration or settings (similar to “Custom HTML” in other Atlassian products) for adding header or footer scripts that can be used for browser monitoring?



3. Template or Resource File Modifications

In the absence of a built-in UI option, would you recommend modifying the Velocity templates or other resource files to inject the New Relic browser snippet?

If so, can you provide best practices or guidance on which files would be most appropriate for modification and how to ensure that these changes persist through upgrades?



4. Marketplace Plugin Options

Are there any officially supported Marketplace plugins or add-ons that facilitate custom header/footer injection for Bitbucket Data Center?

If such plugins exist, could you advise on the recommended plugin(s) and any potential caveats with using them?



5. Reverse Proxy Injection

As an alternative, would configuring our reverse proxy (NGINX/Apache) to inject the New Relic snippet into HTML responses be a supported approach for Bitbucket Data Center?

What potential issues should we be aware of if we choose this method?



6. Upgrade and Maintenance Considerations

How might any custom modifications or injections affect future Bitbucket Data Center upgrades?

What steps should we take to ensure that our monitoring integration remains compatible and maintainable over time?




We appreciate your guidance on this matter and look forward to your recommendations to enable browser monitoring in a manner that is both effective and supported within our Bitbucket Data Center environment.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
