As per the earlier suggestion, we increased the memory on the uDeploy server to 4GB. However, the high utilization issue has resurfaced even after this change. While a restart temporarily resolves the problem, this is not a sustainable solution.

Given that multiple teams rely heavily on this server, and it's critical to our operations, we need to identify and address the root cause as a matter of urgency.

Weâ€™ve attached all the relevant details and logs for your reference. Requesting you to please prioritize this issue and investigate it on an urgent basis.

Thanks for your support.
