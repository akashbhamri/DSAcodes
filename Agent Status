Subject: SQL Server Memory Utilization Threshold Confirmation

Hi Sathr3ddy,

As discussed in our last call, we've observed that the SQL Server memory utilization on the below servers consistently stays around 90%. As we know, it's normal SQL Server behavior to utilize most of the available memory, especially when we've allocated 70–80% of the total server memory for SQL.

We would like to confirm if it's appropriate to set the memory alert threshold at 95% utilization sustained for 15 minutes for the following servers. Please let us know if you're aligned with this approach.

Additionally, just to clarify — even if we increase the total memory, SQL Server will still utilize a similar percentage of it, correct?

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
