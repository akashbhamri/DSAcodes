Short Description:
Request to add the jenkins index to an existing Splunk role for access.

Description:
As per the recommendation from the Splunk team, instead of creating a new role, we are requesting to add the jenkins index to an already existing Splunk role that we currently have access to. This approach ensures consistent role management while allowing us to search and analyze Jenkins-related logs efficiently without duplicating permissions or roles.
