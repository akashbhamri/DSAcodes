Hereâ€™s the updated version including the request for RCA on priority:


---

Short Description:
Index rebuild job ran longer than expected; alert did not trigger

Description:
The index rebuild job exceeded the expected duration, resulting in performance impact. This issue had occurred earlier as well, after which the rebuild window was revised from 9 PM EST to 7 PM EST.

Although an alert was configured by the DBA team, it did not trigger during this occurrence. We are raising this incident to address both the long-running index rebuild and the alert failure.

Requesting the DBA team to investigate and provide the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for both issues on priority.
