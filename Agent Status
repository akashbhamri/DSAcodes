Got it! If you want to question or challenge IBM‚Äôs recommendation to increase the heap size ‚Äî especially since the issue happens only occasionally, not daily ‚Äî here‚Äôs a professional and clear way to frame your message with smart counter-questions:

üì® Message to IBM (heap increment concern):

Hi [IBM Engineer's Name],

Thank you for reviewing the heap dumps and sharing your recommendation to increase the heap size from 2‚Äì4 GB to 8 GB or higher.

However, we‚Äôve observed that the high heap memory issue occurs only at specific times ‚Äî not consistently across all days. With that in mind, we would like to understand more before proceeding with a permanent heap size increase:

‚ùì Our Follow-up Questions:

1. Given that the heap spike happens only during certain time windows, could this be related to a specific job or load pattern instead of an overall heap size limitation?


2. Is there any clear indication of a memory leak or unusual object retention in the dumps from the affected day, versus the other days where the system behaved normally with the current heap settings?


3. Could a temporary or dynamic approach be used (e.g., heap tuning or JVM GC settings optimization) instead of a full heap size increase?


4. Does the dump from May 27 show signs of corruption purely due to heap exhaustion, or could there be other causes (e.g., dump being interrupted, disk space, GC issues)?


5. Before increasing heap permanently to 8 GB or more, can we isolate what exact component/class/thread is driving heap usage abnormally during that time?


6. Would you recommend enabling verbose GC logging or memory analyzer tools proactively, instead of changing the heap right away?

We want to ensure that the root cause is fully understood and addressed appropriately, rather than masking a potential issue with a larger heap.

Looking forward to your guidance on the above.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
