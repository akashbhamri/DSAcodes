Hi Team,

Going forward, please use the below reports to view logs directly in Splunk. Simply click on the “Open in Search” option, and the relevant logs—whether for controller logs or any DevOps server logs—will be displayed automatically. This eliminates the need to copy and paste search queries manually.

Additionally, we’ve created the dashboard below to track tool-related errors as they occur. Kindly start using this dashboard for quick visibility into any issues.

Thanks!
