uDeploy Dev & Prod faced heap memory issues causing UI downtime; restarted to restore service.


uDeploy – Dev & Prod Update

Issue: In both environments, heap memory spike caused OutOfMemoryError and UI became inaccessible.

Collected logs & thread dumps, restarted the application to fix the issue, restore availability, and control impact, then shared details with vendor.

Vendor identified JDBC driver compatibility issue with Java 11 in both environments → recommended replacing ojdbc6.jar with ojdbc8.jar.

Heap memory increased (Dev: 2GB → 8GB, Prod: 4GB → 8GB) and HikariCP pool size increased in Dev (90 → 445).

JDBC driver upgrade & vendor patch applied — Dev on July 25, 2025; Prod on July 26, 2025.

DB query optimization ongoing with DB team to improve performance.

Monitoring in progress – no issues observed post-fix. RCA ongoing (Dev: INCA049439, Prod: INC4117028).
