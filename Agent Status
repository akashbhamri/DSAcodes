We are creating a change plan for correcting the core-per-socket configuration on the following Bitbucket servers, as recommended by the Cloud team: vplbitbucapda01 and vplbitbucapda02. The actual implementation will be carried out by the Cloud team. This change aims to align the configuration with standard requirements. A similar update was previously completed on vplbitbucapda07 and vplbitbucapda08 without any impact.
