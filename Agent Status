Subject: Recurring Account Lockout – AD Team RCA Update

Hi Rodney,

The SVC-APP-RLCT service account was locked again today, and this has become a recurring issue. The Unix team had assigned this to the AD team, and we had a call where Irene Sylvia from AD joined and provided the RCA details.

As per the AD team:

> The issue occurred due to the SVC-APP-RLCT service account getting locked repeatedly as a result of incorrect password attempts. This account is integrated across multiple tools for automation and service-to-service communication.

However, the exact source of the incorrect password attempts could not be identified. The AD team was unable to trace the issue because all authentication traffic is routed via a VIP (Load Balancer), which masks the actual Domain Controller (DC) causing the lockout. Hence, the DC is not directly visible in the logs.

Fix: The account was automatically unlocked. No changes were made from our end.

Business Impact: No impact.

Next Steps: The platform team is working to eliminate the dependency on the shared SVC-APP-RLCT account and will implement separate service accounts per tool. This is to isolate authentication flows, improve traceability, and prevent similar issues going forward.



Since nothing further can be done from the AD team’s side, this has now been assigned to our DL.

Let me know if you need any additional details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
