Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance on Production Outage Due to Query – INC Raised on 21st

Hi [Team Name / Specific Contact],

We have been trying to reach out via Teams multiple times without receiving a response. This is regarding the incident we raised on 21st [mention month if needed], which is causing severe outages on our production server every time the query is run.

While we have received AWR reports and recommendations, we need your assistance to understand and implement the proposed optimizations. Currently, we’re stuck and unable to proceed further without your guidance.

Given the impact on production, we request you to treat this with high priority and help us with:

1. Clarification on the recommended changes.


2. Concrete steps or query optimization techniques we can apply.


3. Any support you can provide to avoid further outages.



Kindly escalate this internally if required, and share a suitable time for a call or direct support session at the earliest.

Looking forward to your prompt response.
