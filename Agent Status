Slide Title: Jenkins Jobs â€“ Use Cases

Please find below the details of each job I created and its use case:


---

ðŸ”¹ 1. CONTROLLERS_REACHABILITY_CHECK

This job checks the status of all controllers in CBCI.

It runs every 7 minutes to ping the controllers.

It checks the response time and successful return codes.

If any wrong code is returned or the controller is not reachable, an alert will be triggered.



---

ðŸ”¹ 2. CRITICAL_TOOL_REACHABILITY_CHECK

This job performs a similar check for critical DevOps tools.

Tools covered: UDeploy, Bitbucket, CBCD, SonarQube, Nexus, Jenkins.

It verifies whether the tools are reachable and responding correctly.

Any tool failure or incorrect response will trigger an alert.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Network_Health_Check

This job checks the network connectivity of all servers at once.

It avoids the need to check each server manually.

Useful for validating connectivity across all servers quickly.

The results are stored in a CSV file for easy reference and tracking.



---

ðŸ”¹ 4. Thread_AND_Heap_Dump_Collector

This job is used to collect thread and heap dumps during issue analysis.

It automates the manual process of collecting dumps from servers.

Helpful for identifying the root cause of memory issues or performance degradation.
