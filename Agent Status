Since Tanium doesn’t provide file-level access tracking capabilities, and the NAS team is also unable to monitor folder or file-level changes, we're currently unable to identify who made the modifications. However, I noticed that auditd is already installed on the server, which could help us track such changes. I’ll reach out to the OS Engineering team to check if it can be enabled for monitoring purposes and will keep you posted.
