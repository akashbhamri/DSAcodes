It's been almost 5 days, but the default software like Outlook and Microsoft Office still hasn't been installed on my system.

When I try to raise an RITM manually, it asks for cost center details, which I believe shouldn't be required for standard installations.

Could you please look into this or guide me on the correct process to get this resolved?
