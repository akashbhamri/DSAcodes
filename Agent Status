Monitoring team is responsible only for monitoring alerts that come directly from tools like New Relic, Splunk, or for node-down scenarios. Any alerts triggered by custom scripts are outside the scope of Monitoring. Until such scripts are officially communicated and properly handed over to the Monitoring team, they will remain the responsibility of the team that created them.
