DevOps Support DL will be added to alerts generated from Splunk and custom scripts. These alerts must be monitored accordingly. For New Relic, although the DL will not be added, any alerts containing keywords such as CloudBees CI, uDeploy, Bitbucket, Nexus, Jenkins, Sonar, CloudBees, Controller, or Pod should still be monitored by the team.
