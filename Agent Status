team had created the directory directly under 07/appbin for the New Relic APM (new version) installation in Bitbucket. We were initially unaware that this change was required to proceed with the setup. However, since the path wasnâ€™t added to any configuration file and only the directory was created and the JAR extracted, there was no impact.

Moving forward, we will ensure that such changes go through the proper change process, including adding the necessary path references in relevant files.
