Nice — I updated the whole INCIDENT text using the details you provided (hostnames, IPs, services, change ref, and log times). Paste this into your INC record (or use as the ticket comment) — I included a short exec summary and two chat-ready messages you can drop to the network engineer.

Incident: INC4124558

Issue Summary:
On 2025-08-22, our team observed that Bitbucket and CBCD were down and users were unable to access them. Jenkins and SonarQube were also observed to be unavailable around the same time. The outages coincided with the Dallas SF network routing activity (CHG0080206 — BGP migration for all VDCs; EIGRP → BGP). Connectivity to our servers was impacted and services became unavailable until routing stabilized.

Affected Services / Servers:

Bitbucket (confirmed impacted)

CBCD (confirmed impacted)

Jenkins (impact under investigation)

SonarQube on vplr1ctapda17 / vplr1ctapda19 — IPs 10.81.0.34 and 10.148.33.159 (NSX ranges)


Start Time (INC record): 2025-08-22 00:10:00
Observed service stop (SonarQube logs): 2025-08-22 02:18:06 (exit code 143 — graceful shutdown / SIGTERM)
Resolved Time: 2025-08-22 04:09:00

Inconclusive Root Cause Analysis:
The disruption happened during the Dallas SF routing migration (CHG0080206). Some routes in the Dallas SF environment (SF Dev/Prod/Cloud/Storage/ISZ) were being migrated from EIGRP to BGP. This migration likely caused temporary loss of advertised routes for certain NSX-managed ranges. As a result, connectivity to our servers (including the NSX IPs above) was interrupted. SonarQube shows a graceful shutdown (exit code 143), indicating an external stop/restart signal rather than an application crash. Bitbucket and CBCD were confirmed impacted by the activity; for Jenkins and SonarQube we need network confirmation whether their NSX ranges were included in the change scope.


---

Fix:
Connectivity was restored automatically once routing advertisements stabilized. No corrective changes were performed from our application/ops side.


---

Business Impact:

Bitbucket and CBCD were unavailable to users during the activity window.

Jenkins and SonarQube were unreachable for a period (SonarQube logged a graceful stop at 02:18:06).

Users were unable to perform normal tasks on the impacted tools while connectivity was lost.



---

Next Steps / Action Items:

1. Network team: Please confirm whether the NSX ranges 10.81.x.x and 10.148.x.x (hosts vplr1ctapda17 / vplr1ctapda19) were included in CHG0080206 scope. Also confirm if any VM restarts or controlled shutdowns were part of the change.


2. Review routing migration procedures to ensure advertised scope includes NSX-managed subnets and to prevent similar impact.


3. Improve pre-change communication so dependent application teams are notified in advance.


4. Ops to monitor for any re-occurrence and gather deeper application logs if needed.

Executive summary (2–3 lines)

On 22-Aug-2025, Bitbucket and CBCD experienced outage during Dallas SF routing migration (CHG0080206 — EIGRP → BGP). Jenkins and SonarQube also went unreachable; SonarQube logs show a graceful shutdown at 02:18:06 (exit code 143). Requesting network confirmation whether NSX ranges 10.81.x.x and 10.148.x.x were included in the change scope.

One-line chat to network (paste in Teams/Slack)

Hi <Name>, during CHG0080206 our servers vplr1ctapda17/19 (IPs 10.81.0.34, 10.148.33.159) were impacted — can you confirm whether these NSX ranges were part of the Dallas SF BGP migration and whether any VM shutdowns/restarts were performed?

Short quick message for INC comment

Bitbucket/CBCD outages confirmed due to CHG0080206 (Dallas SF EIGRP→BGP). Jenkins/SonarQube impact under investigation — SonarQube logs show graceful shutdown at 02:18:06 (exit 143). Network please confirm if NSX ranges 10.81.x.x / 10.148.x.x were in scope.
