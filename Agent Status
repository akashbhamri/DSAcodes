Got it! Here's a refined and clear version including your point about the script and Splunk plugin issue:


---

Hi Praneeth,

We’ve raised an RITM for creating a new AD group for the Splunk Jenkins index, since approval for the existing AD group is still pending from the app owner. The request is currently in progress.

In Prod, I created a script that verifies the Splunk configuration, and I’m able to see events being pushed through when triggered manually via the script. However, the issue seems to be with the Splunk Jenkins plugin, which is not sending the events as expected.

In Dev, the plugin is installed and events are visible in Splunk. But the CI/CD setup is incomplete, and there's an additional issue with worker node connectivity, which I'm actively working on.

Once Dev is fully functional and validated, we can replicate the working setup to Prod and address the plugin issue effectively.

Will keep you updated on further progress.
