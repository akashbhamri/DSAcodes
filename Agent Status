Hi Rahul,

Here’s what we usually do for any patching activity:

1. Check the Unix team’s email and collect the list of servers from the attached sheet.


2. Update the server list in the platform team chat, since they have scheduled weekend activities.


3. Wait for confirmation from the platform team:

If there’s no activity, we prepare the communication and inform the application team.

If there is any activity, we raise an RITM and reschedule the patching.



4. Before patching, we manually bring down most of the services running on the servers.


5. Once the Unix team completes the patching, we bring up the services we had stopped.


6. We then monitor all tools to check if they are working as expected, including reviewing the New Relic dashboard.



Let me know if you need more details on any step.
