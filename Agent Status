Perfect, here’s the revised version with “dead end” moved to the end as you requested:

Bitbucket pod went into memory spike during index rebuild job running for longer than usual.

No RCA from DB team as they don’t maintain query execution data once it’s completed.

Vendor observed table AO_xxxx with huge data contributing to slowness.

We are setting up an alert to capture index rebuild completion time, query details, and other necessary parameters.

As of now, the index rebuild job is rescheduled to run every Saturday at 7 PM.

If the job exceeds 10 minutes, the alert will be triggered automatically.

This will help in proactive monitoring and quick investigation of issues in future.

As of now, we are at a dead end for RCA due to DB limitation.
