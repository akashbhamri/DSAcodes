We have analyzed the high CPU usage observed on May 26 around 3:55 PM using New Relic APM and uDeploy.

We checked uDeploy and confirmed that there were no heavy or high-resource deployments during that time (also verified for May 9).

In New Relic, we identified that a Java thread named jese-nio-exec was consuming high CPU. This thread is commonly associated with Netty, which handles asynchronous HTTP request processing.

Notably, this same thread was observed running during both days when the issue occurred (May 9 and May 26), and was in a Runnable state, meaning it was actively executing code.

A drop in the Appdex score was also seen, indicating some performance impact during the spike.


Next Steps:

We are sharing these findings with the vendor team for further analysis.

If any issue is confirmed with this thread or related processing, we’ll take necessary action accordingly.

We’ll share an update once we receive feedback from the vendor.
