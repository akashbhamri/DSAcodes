Subject: Request to Check Feasibility of Scaling EQXH Nodes to 200 GB RAM

Hi [Team/Name],

Hope you’re doing well.

We’ve received a requirement from the application team that’s using the EQXH worker nodes for running Cypress e2e tests. They’re planning to scale up parallel execution, which will significantly increase memory usage on these nodes.

Based on their current plan:

Each container requires ~4 GB RAM

Each executor will run 8 containers

There will be 6 executors per node
This adds up to roughly 192 GB, so they’re requesting 200 GB RAM per node to support the setup.


Here are the nodes in scope:

DEV:

WorkerNode_01 to WorkerNode_04


PROD:

WorkerNode_01 to WorkerNode_03


Could you please confirm:

1. If it’s technically feasible to scale these nodes to 200 GB RAM?


2. If not, are there alternative options you’d suggest?


3. Would there be any downtime or steps needed from our side?



This activity is planned to be taken up post-freeze, but we’d like to confirm feasibility in advance.

Let me know if you need any further details.

Thanks & regards,
Akash

Let me know if your org uses a more casual tone or internal shorthand—happy to adjust.

As of now, this will be planned post-freeze, but we’d like to assess feasibility early based on your inputs.
