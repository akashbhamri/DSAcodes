Despite informing the team multiple times to notify us in advance before muting alerts for any planned activity, they are still not keeping us in the loop. This continues to cause confusion and leads to unnecessary time being spent on investigating alerts that were expected to be suppressed.

We request your intervention in resolving this recurring issue and ensuring proper communication from the team going forward.
