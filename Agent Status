Yes Basharaf, since CloudBees CD comes with an embedded JRE, it includes only the Java runtime (java) and does not include developer or diagnostic tools like javac, jstack, or jmap.

Thatâ€™s why we need to separately install the full JDK on our systems to perform advanced diagnostics such as thread dumps or performance analysis.
