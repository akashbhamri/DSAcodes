Incident Summary:
Alert: [vdlrctdp04v1] UDeploy Dev Server – CPU Utilization above 90% for over 30 minutes.

Action Taken:
Upon receiving the alert, we immediately logged into the server to investigate. We observed that the UDeploy Dev server was experiencing high CPU usage due to a background Java process.
We restarted the UDeploy server, after which the performance normalized. Additionally, we reviewed logs and gathered thread and heap dumps for further analysis. We also consulted Hema Ralle and captured her inputs.

As this is a recurring issue, we raised a vendor ticket. As advised previously, the CPU limit was increased from 2 to 4 GB, but the issue persists. Further suggestions from the vendor are awaited to prevent recurrence.

Impact:
UDeploy Dev server was down, resulting in application impact for approximately 30 minutes.
