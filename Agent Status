Certainly! Here's a more detailed and context-rich version of your message to ask about the "good" Web Transaction Time (WTT) for the CBCD application:

> Subject: Clarification on Acceptable Web Transaction Time (WTT) for CBCD Application

Hi [Team/CBCD App Owner/PO Name],

I hope you're doing well.

While reviewing the APM metrics (especially in New Relic) for the CBCD application, I noticed varying response times across different web transactions. To ensure our monitoring and alerting is aligned with business expectations and user experience, Iâ€™d like to understand the baseline or expected performance threshold for Web Transaction Time (WTT) specific to this application.

Could you please help clarify the following:

1. What is the acceptable average response time (WTT) for the CBCD application under normal load?


2. Is there an SLA (Service Level Agreement) defined for end-to-end response times?


3. Are there any business-critical transactions (e.g., login, payment, search, etc.) that have different response time expectations?


4. Should we consider any external service call durations or DB latency separately, or should we use the total WTT as the benchmark?


5. Is there any documentation or historical benchmark that we can refer to for defining alert thresholds (e.g., anything above 800ms should be flagged)?



My goal is to ensure that our monitoring setup correctly reflects the actual performance expectations and avoids unnecessary alerts or, conversely, missing critical degradation signals.

Please let me know your thoughts or direct me to someone who can provide this information.

Thanks & Regards,
Akash Bhamri
