"Just a reminder, I had requested an update on the concern discussed during yesterday's call, which you agreed to raise in the vendor ticket. Since LDAP is stating there are no issues on their end, it might be better to inform them that we've received feedback from the vendor and request them to investigate further, rather than simply stating there's no issue."
