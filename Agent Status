Incident Update – High Heap Utilization on UDeploy

Issue Summary:
We received an alert from heap.memory.usage indicating high heap memory utilization on the UDeploy application. On investigation, we found high query consumption contributing to memory pressure. There is also an open JDBC compatibility issue already tracked via RITM.

Actions Taken:

Increased heap memory from 4GB to 8GB.

Restarted the application service, which restored normal performance.

Collected and shared AWR reports, heap dumps, and query details in the vendor ticket for further analysis.

JDBC patch testing is ongoing in sandbox; once validated, it will be deployed to DEV and PROD.


Current Status:

The application is stable after the heap increase and restart.

Monitoring continues while we await vendor feedback on query optimization.


Business Impact: No major impact post resolution.
Downtime: ~10 minutes during service restart.
RCA: In progress — vendor analysis and JDBC patch rollout pending.
