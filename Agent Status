Perfect üëç You want to highlight that the AWR report was only addressed after multiple follow-ups, and now you need guidance on how to raise an incident for a non-prod DB instead of a RITM (since RITMs go through approvals and take longer).

Here‚Äôs a clear and professional version you can use:

Hello Team,

The AWR report request was addressed only after multiple follow-ups. Separately, we received a recovery group filled alert on a non-prod DB (Udeploy DEV). Since this type of issue is critical and can directly impact availability (we have already seen the DEC server go down due to the same issue earlier), we would like to understand the proper procedure to create an Incident for a non-prod DB.

RITMs go through an approval process and cause delays, but incidents allow faster prioritization and resolution. Please confirm the correct approach so that we can raise such cases as Incidents going forward.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

üëâ Do you want me to make this shortened into 2‚Äì3 lines so you can paste it directly into the ServiceNow comments/description?





Got it üëç I read your original message carefully. Here‚Äôs a polished reply that conveys your points clearly and professionally, combining everything into one content:

Hello Team,

One ticket is for an AWR report, which we have been following up on for the last 4‚Äì5 days but still has not been addressed. Another ticket is for a recovery group filled alert, which is critical since we already faced an issue earlier where the same alert caused the DEC server to go down.

For your information, this database belongs to the Udeploy DEV environment, which is used by multiple application teams. Hence, instead of raising a RITM, we request that an Incident be created for this DB server so that it can be prioritized and resolved appropriately.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to also make a super-short version (1‚Äì2 sentences) you can use as the Incident justification in ServiceNow?
