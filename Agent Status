We’re observing multiple authentication errors in the logs specifically for one Active Directory (AD). These repeated failures are also triggering Splunk alerts.

Please note that this issue is isolated to this particular AD — other ADs are not showing the same behavior. Could you please help investigate the root cause of these errors?

Let me know if any additional details or logs are needed.
