Hi team,

Please remember to follow the process for muting alerts whenever any planned activity is scheduled on the tools. Here are the key points:

- **Alert Mute Window**: Ensure you specify the exact time frame for muting the alerts, including both the start and end times.

- **Activity Confirmation**: Make sure to confirm the planned activity in the RITM (Request Item) and include a request to unmute the alerts once the activity is completed.

- **RITM Closure**: Include a note in the RITM not to close it until we provide confirmation that the alerts have been unmuted.

- **Monitoring Team Coordination**: When raising the RITM, please include the monitoring team so we are aware of which alerts are being muted.
