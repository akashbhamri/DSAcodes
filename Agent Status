This is an urgent escalation. We are facing a severe performance issue on node vplrlctapda08, where the load average is extremely high, and the response time has significantly degraded. This issue is isolated to this node â€” all other nodes are stable.

As a result, we were forced to bring down the BB service on this node to prevent further impact.

We have already attached the Red Hat analysis and all relevant logs for your review. Despite previous attempts to reach out, we have not received any actionable support so far.

We request your immediate involvement and resolution. The impact is critical and business-affecting, and we need this addressed on top priority.

Looking forward to a prompt response.
