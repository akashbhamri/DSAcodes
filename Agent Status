As per our standard process, we are not supposed to add individual users directly to branch permissions. Instead, we manage access through authorized groups to ensure consistency, better access control, and easier audit management.

We noticed that a user has been added directly to branch permissions. Could you please help us understand the reason for this deviation? If there is a valid business need, kindly share it so we can review and handle it appropriately.
