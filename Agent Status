ðŸ“Œ Status Update on Heap Size Recommendation for DOD Tool

The vendor is still analyzing the heap and thread dumps related to the recent memory issue.

In the meantime, they have recommended increasing the heap size from the current 4 GB to more than 8 GB, with a maximum suggested limit of 13 GB for the DOD tool. This is based on their preliminary assessment.

However, since the issue is not consistently occurring and we want to ensure the root cause is fully understood, weâ€™ve shared our concerns and follow-up questions with the vendor â€” particularly around:

Whether the spike is related to specific load patterns or jobs,

If there's any indication of a memory leak,

And whether alternative optimizations (e.g., GC tuning or memory cleanup) can be explored before increasing heap permanently.


We have requested the vendor to conduct a deeper analysis of the heap and thread dumps and are currently awaiting their detailed response before moving forward with any heap size change.
