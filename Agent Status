We are correcting the core-per-socket configuration on the following Bitbucket servers as per the Cloud team's recommendation: vplbitbucapda01 and vplbitbucapda02. This adjustment is aimed at aligning the server settings with the required specifications. Similar changes were already successfully implemented on Prod-07 and Prod-08 without any issues.
