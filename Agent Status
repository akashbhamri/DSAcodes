Subject: Temporary Reassignment of UDeploy Access RITM

Hi Team,

Please refrain from assigning the UDeploy access RITM to the Monitoring team at this time. We are currently facing an issue in the pipeline that is preventing access from being provisioned correctly to the application team. As a result, the RITM remains in a pending state.

We are reassigning the UDeploy access RITM back to the Admin team for now. Once the issue is resolved, we will notify you, and you may proceed with the assignment accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation.
