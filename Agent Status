Here's a more polished and professional way to say what you’re trying to convey:


---

"Please note that the heap dump will only be generated when an OutOfMemoryError occurs. Ensure that the specified path exists and has the correct permissions. Also, it's recommended to implement a cleanup mechanism to avoid disk space issues — for example, automatically deleting heap dumps that are older than 5 days if they are not retrieved from the server within that time."

Or, a slightly shorter version:

"Heap dumps will be created only in the event of an OutOfMemoryError. Please ensure the specified directory exists with appropriate permissions. To avoid disk space accumulation, a cleanup mechanism should be implemented to delete heap dumps older than 5 days if they are not retrieved."

Let me know if you want a sample cleanup script too.
