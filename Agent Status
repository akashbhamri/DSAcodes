Following the recent Okta integration, our synthetic alert for URL monitoring has stopped functioning. This alert is crucial for our team, and we need to re-establish it as soon as possibleâ€”either by resolving the current issue or implementing an alternative monitoring solution.

Could you please investigate this on priority and suggest a fix or a feasible workaround?
