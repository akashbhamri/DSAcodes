As part of our performance review and monitoring process, we're currently evaluating our system's web transaction time and throughput. We've come across the following industry sources and would like to know if they are valid for assessing our environment in the context of your platform and expected behavior:

1. Reddit DevOps Rule-of-Thumb (Throughput Thresholds)

> Low: <10–100 RPS (600–6,000 RPM)
Moderate: 100–1,000 RPS (6,000–60,000 RPM)
High: 1,000–10,000 RPS (60,000–600,000 RPM)

2. Web/API Response Time Expectations (Reddit/StackOverflow)

> Average response time target: 10–25 ms
Threshold for concern: >200 ms under load
[Source: Developer community input on acceptable response time for production APIs]





We would appreciate it if you could confirm:

Are these benchmarks in line with the performance standards and architecture of your platform?

Can we use them as a valid reference when evaluating our current throughput ([insert ms])?

Do you have any internal or published guidance you'd recommend for a more platform-specific assessment?


Your confirmation will help us make more accurate decisions regarding tuning, scaling, and SLA alignment.
