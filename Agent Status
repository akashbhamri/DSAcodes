Certainly! Here's a revised and professional version of your message including the fallback mechanism and RCA reference for the rebuild index job:

Hi [Recipient's Name],

We need a justification for why the time was not changed this time, Sati. Kindly refer to the email chain below for more context.

Additionally, we would like to request the RCA for the rebuild index job, along with a defined fallback mechanism to ensure the issue does not reoccur. This will also help us avoid similar problems in the future.

Please let me know if we can schedule a call today to discuss this in more detail.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
