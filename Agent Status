alert is being triggered by a custom script created by the Build team. As per our Confluence documentation, the Monitoring team is responsible only for monitoring alerts that come directly from tools like New Relic, Splunk, or for node-down scenarios. Any alerts triggered by custom scripts are outside the scope of Monitoring, and the respective team that owns the script is responsible for managing and monitoring those alerts.
