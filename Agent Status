ðŸ“§ Subject: Follow-Up: Alert Muting Not Communicated by Team for Upcoming Planned Activity

Body:

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

As part of the standard process, the concerned team was expected to notify us and proceed with muting alerts for the upcoming planned activity. Despite informing them in advance and multiple follow-ups, we have yet to receive any confirmation or update.

This lack of communication is resulting in unnecessary alert investigations and confusion, consuming valuable time and effort.

We request your support in addressing this issue on priority to ensure smooth execution of the activity.

Please let us know if any further inputs are needed from our side.

Best regards,
Akash Bhamri
