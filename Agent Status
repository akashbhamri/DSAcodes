Subject: Follow-up on High CPU Utilization - Java Process Root Cause and Preventive Actions

Hi [Recipient/Team],

Thanks for the update regarding the cause of high CPU utilization being linked to a Java process. However, since the process has already completed and we donâ€™t have the required permissions to analyze it in depth, we still need clarity on a few points:

1. What exactly within the Java process led to such a high CPU spike?


2. Can this behavior occur again under similar load/conditions?


3. Do we need to consider scaling resources (CPU/memory) on this critical server to handle such scenarios more effectively?


4. What best practices or tuning can be implemented to prevent such high utilization going forward?



We request that a case be raised with Red Hat to help us get detailed insights and recommendations for long-term mitigation.

Let us know once the case is initiated or if you need additional information from our side.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
