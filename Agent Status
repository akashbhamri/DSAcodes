Hi Praneeth,

I've reviewed both the JIRA tickets, and I believe the work on CloudBees Analytics, especially in collaboration with the vendor, would require more than 3 hours daily.

At the moment, I’m currently leading the monitoring team and handling several other critical tasks, so I unfortunately don’t have the bandwidth to take this on effectively. I hope you understand, and please let me know if there’s any other way I can support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
