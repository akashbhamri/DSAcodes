Got it! If you're reaching out to the vendor (Atlassian or plugin provider) for guidance, here’s a clean and professional way to frame your message:

✉️ Message to Vendor:

> Hi Team,

We are seeing continuous growth in the following database tables related to scan data:

AO_D9E976_SCAN

AO_D9E976_REF_SCAN

AO_D9E976_REPO_SCAN

AO_D9E976_INVALID_LINE

AO_D9E976_PROJECT_ROLLUP


As part of our housekeeping efforts, we are planning to drop and regenerate these tables periodically using the "Scan All" feature after cleanup.

Could you please help us with:

1. The ideal or recommended size threshold (in MB or GB) for each of these tables before we take action?


2. The recommended frequency (weekly, monthly, etc.) for cleaning them up in a production environment?


3. Whether there is any risk to performance or data if these tables grow beyond a certain size?



We are also looking to set up automated alerts for table growth, so an ideal threshold from your end will help us tune that correctly.

Thanks in advance for your guidance.
