Team, I noticed that only 3 Jenkins servers are listed in the sheet, but we have other Jenkins servers as well (including worker nodes). Could you please confirm if this is a partial list or if other Jenkins servers will be included in the scope later? Just want to ensure we don’t miss any connections.”
