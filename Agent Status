Hi Karishma, thanks for your help. The team has raised two additional requests: one is to add the import user functionality to the existing UDeploy script, and the other is to create a new script for adding users to Stash/Bitbucket. Could you please prioritize these tasks and try to include them in the upcoming sprint if possible? Thanks again for your support.
