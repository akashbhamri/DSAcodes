Here’s an improved and professional version of the Validation Steps section, including the use of APM (Application Performance Monitoring) for post-validation:

Validation Plan:

1. Confirm socket configuration changes have been applied successfully on both vplbitbucapda01 and vplbitbucapda02 by checking system-level settings.


2. Capture before and after configuration snapshots for audit and reference purposes.


3. Verify service health status after the restart at the OS level.


4. Use APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Dynatrace, or relevant monitoring platform) to:

Monitor application response times

Track CPU and memory performance

Ensure there are no performance degradations or anomalies



5. Cross-check logs for any warnings or errors post-implementation.


6. Coordinate with the application/Bitbucket team to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.


7. Share validation report (including APM graphs, health check status, and screenshots) with the Cloud team and stakeholders.

Let me know if you’d like this added to the Excel sheet text as well, or need a backout plan section written just in case.
