Today, our uDeploy application experienced an outage due to a server-side process crash triggered by an unexpected spike in heap memory usage. Upon thorough investigation, we determined that this incident coincided with a QA deployment executed at 4:19 PM. During the deployment, the "Push Application Pallet" step unusually took about 28 minutes to upload the required files. This prolonged operation dramatically increased heap memory consumption, eventually rendering the application unresponsive and causing the process crash.

We are currently reviewing our deployment procedures and memory management strategies to prevent future occurrences.
