Subject: Request for Review: Updated Architecture Diagram Based on Discussion

Hi Team,

As per our recent discussion, I’ve updated the architecture diagram to include the following points:

DR not running (noted)

HTTPS 443 AD communication in PHX

Elasticsearch two-way communication

NAS team data mirroring (Validation)

Clarification on DR to PROD NAS connection

Current state of DR NAS (read/write)

Last arrow representing PROD to PHX DB (clarified as confusion point)


I’ve incorporated these changes in the latest version of the diagram. Kindly review the updates and let me know if anything additional needs to be added or modified.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Akash
