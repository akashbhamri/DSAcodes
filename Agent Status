I’ve noticed that several standard applications—such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook—as well as other commonly used software and basic services are not available on my new AWS workspace.

Could you please confirm if this is the expected default setup? Additionally, is there a standard procedure or configuration to automatically install these applications and services?
