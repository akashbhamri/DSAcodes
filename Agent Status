Unable to connect to network in new AWS WorkSpace

Detailed Description:
Iâ€™m facing a network connectivity issue in a newly created AWS WorkSpace. I'm unable to connect to the internet or internal network. The WorkSpace launches but does not allow any network access. Security groups, VPC, and route tables appear configured, but no connectivity is established. Please assist in resolving the network issue.
