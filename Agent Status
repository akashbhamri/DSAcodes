Subject: Ongoing Alert Issue on Server vdljenkinapda11 – RCA Required

Hi Vimal,

We have raised this INC regarding an alert that we are receiving regularly on the server vdljenkinapda11. Since this alert keeps recurring and the RITM has already been closed, we need a proper Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for this issue.

Please ensure that a permanent solution is implemented so that the alert does not occur again. If needed, we can explore alternate ways to suppress or drop it—such as via email or other methods.

Looking forward to your inputs on this.

Thanks,
Akash
