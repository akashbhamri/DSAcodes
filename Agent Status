Here are a few clearer and more professional ways to say this message:


---

Option 1: Formal and clear
"After the UDeploy Dev APM restart, we noticed that metrics are not being displayed. This data is critical for our monitoring. We may need to restart the service again to check if the metrics load properly. Please let me know a suitable time to proceed with the restart."


---

Option 2: Polite and concise
"The APM metrics are not appearing after the UDeploy Dev restart. Since these metrics are important, we’d like to try restarting the service again. Could you let us know when would be a good time to do this?"


---

Option 3: Direct but respectful
"UDeploy Dev APM isn't showing metrics after the recent restart. These metrics are critical, so we’d like to restart the service once more to verify if they load. Please confirm a convenient time for the restart."

Let me know if you’d like a more casual or technical version
