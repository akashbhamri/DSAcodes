“Yes Anbu, the server returns to normal once the process is completed. The memory increase is only due to SQL behavior. CPU and load average remain within normal thresholds, and there's no impact unless all three metrics—memory, CPU, and load—are high simultaneously. Even the DB team receives these alerts. Also, this is a DR (Disaster Recovery) server, used only when production is inaccessible or has issues. Currently, no application teams are actively using this server.”
