Sure! Here's the updated version with that point clearly added:

Hi Praneeth,

We’ve raised an RITM for creating a new AD group for the Splunk Jenkins index, as we’re not getting approval for the existing group from the app owner. The request is currently in progress.

In Prod, I created a script that verifies the Splunk configuration, and I can see events being pushed when triggered manually via the script. However, events are still not coming through via the Splunk Jenkins plugin.

Since I don’t have access to Prod, I’m unable to validate or troubleshoot the plugin issue directly there. That’s why I’m focusing on setting up and testing everything thoroughly in the Dev environment.

In Dev, the plugin is installed and events are visible in Splunk. However, the CI/CD pipeline isn’t fully set up yet, and there’s also a connectivity issue with the worker node, which I’m currently working to resolve.

Once Dev is stable and the end-to-end flow is confirmed, we’ll use that as a reference to address the issue in Prod.

Will keep you posted on progress.
