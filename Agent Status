Escalation Summary and Step-by-Step Resolution

1. Escalation Received
An escalation was received from the application team stating that our team closed the RITM without confirmation from the user.


2. Initial Action Taken
Our team had provided access at the component level and requested confirmation from the user.


3. User Response
The user didnâ€™t respond initially. The next day, she replied that she was unable to access the logs, even after the component-level access was provided.


4. Root Cause Identified
Upon investigation, we found that this was due to a generic process created by the automation team, which did not include the team name during the resource creation.


5. Fix Implemented by Automation Team
We informed the automation team. They updated the generic process to ensure the team name is included while creating the resource.
After this change, the user was able to access the logs successfully.


6. Updated Closure Procedure
Previously, the team was closing RITMs after requesting confirmation and waiting briefly.
We have now updated the process to avoid similar escalations:

The team will request confirmation both via:

RITM additional comments, and

IM (Teams) chat with the requester.


If no response is received, the team will wait for 2 days after access is provided.

After 2 days, if there is still no response:

Add a note in the RITM additional comments stating that access was given and no reply was received within the 2-day window.

Then proceed to close the RITM.




7. Communication to Team
The updated process has been shared with the team, and everyone is expected to follow it going forward to prevent such issues.
