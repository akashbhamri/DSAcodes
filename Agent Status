Here’s a detailed yet easy-to-follow version:

> We observed that Bitbucket Server 08 was much slower than usual—its load average and response times were unusually high—while our other four servers continued to operate normally. To diagnose the problem, we collected all relevant logs, performance metrics, and configuration details, then opened a support ticket with our vendor.

As an initial attempt to clear any transient issues, we restarted the Bitbucket service twice, but each time the high load and slow response recurred shortly afterward. When we escalated to Red Hat support, they asked us to capture server “snapshots” (for example, sosreport archives or LVM snapshots) so they could analyze the system state in depth.

We’ve since taken the following steps:

1. Provided Diagnostics: Delivered the collected logs and metrics to the vendor and generated the requested system snapshots.


2. Restarted with Caution: Brought the server back online after each restart and verified that the application came up correctly.


3. Ongoing Monitoring: Implemented continuous monitoring of CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, and Bitbucket-specific metrics to catch any spikes immediately.



At this point, Red Hat engineers will review the snapshots and guide us toward the root cause. Meanwhile, our team continues to track system performance in real time to ensure Bitbucket Server 08 remains stable.
