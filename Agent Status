Got it üëç Let me reframe and explain your message in a clear, professional, and structured way so it‚Äôs easy for others to understand:

Issue Summary:
There were two aspects to this alert.

1. Unix Policy Alert:

This alert was triggered from the main Unix monitoring policy.

We are not permitted to mute alerts from this policy.

On our side, the server was not included in the monitoring condition.

The task of updating servers in the condition was already assigned, but Satish from the monitoring team did not replace the old server with the new one.

As a result, we missed some alerts. The team has been informed, and they are working on priority to ensure all missed servers are added into the condition.



2. Backup Alert (CBCD Upgrade Activity):

This alert was generated due to the CBCD upgrade activity.

A 3-month-old backup was already available on the server.

Since this was a new activity, the team initiated a fresh backup.

While the new backup was in progress, the old backup had not yet been deleted, which caused the alert to trigger (threshold exceeded).

The DB team has now cleaned up the older backup, and the alert is back under threshold.

‚úÖ This version is professional, precise, and explains both issues without sounding like blame-shifting.

Do you want me to make it more formal (for email to client/manager) or slightly casual (for internal team chat/update)?
