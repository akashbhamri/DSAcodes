Subject: Request to Review and Address Recurring High Server Utilization

Hi [Name],

As discussed during the call, weâ€™ve observed that the server utilization is spiking frequently, and this has become a recurring issue.

Could you please review this internally and also coordinate with the IAC team to identify the root cause and suggest possible long-term solutions to prevent this from happening again?

Additionally, kindly keep us posted on the progress and any updates on this.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
