Yes, we have also observed the "heap out of memory" issue. As per your recommendation, we have already increased the heap size to 4GB. However, we are still experiencing the issue intermittently.

Interestingly, we have the same setup running in production without encountering this problem, which suggests that there may be something specific running at the time that is triggering this behavior.

We need to identify the exact cause of the memory spike during those periods. Continuously increasing the memory allocation is not a sustainable solution.

Kindly investigate further and provide your insights on the root cause of this issue.
