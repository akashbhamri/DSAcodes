We have received updates from our Nexus Repository vendor regarding performance improvements and best practices. Below is a summary of their recommendations:


---

üõ†Ô∏è Key Recommendations:

1. Switch to PostgreSQL Database:

Why: The current embedded database (H2/OrientDB) may not efficiently handle our growing data and request volumes.

Benefit: PostgreSQL offers better performance, scalability, and reliability for large-scale operations.



2. Enable Auto-Blocking on Proxy Repositories:

Why: Some proxy repositories are not responding promptly, leading to unnecessary thread consumption.

Benefit: Enabling auto-blocking (httpclient.autoBlock=true) will prevent these repositories from consuming threads when not responding in time.

üîß Action Items:

Database Migration: Plan and execute the migration from the embedded database to PostgreSQL.

Configuration Update: Enable auto-blocking on the identified proxy repositories.


To facilitate the implementation of these recommendations, we have raised the following RITMs with the Platform Team:

RITM1234567 ‚Äì PostgreSQL Database Migration

RITM7654321 ‚Äì Proxy Repository Configuration Update
