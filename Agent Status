Great! Here's the final version with everything included:

You're renaming instead of dropping.

You're informing the Soteri vendor and awaiting their suggestions.

You'll delete the tables only if no issues are found.

You require sign-off from the DB team for the rename.

This version is professional and suitable for email, documentation, or a PPT slide:

ðŸ”§ Soteri Table Cleanup Approach â€“ Pending Vendor Review & DB Sign-Off

As discussed during the call, the DB team will rename the identified tables by appending _copy instead of dropping them directly. This will ensure data preservation while allowing us to proceed with validation.

Once the renaming is complete, we will restart the Soteri plugin to allow it to recreate the required tables.

The system will be monitored over the next couple of weeks to verify that Soteri functions as expected with no issues.

We are currently informing the Soteri vendor of this approach and will proceed further based on their feedback and recommendations.

If no issues are observed during the monitoring period, we will proceed to delete the renamed tables to free up space.

A formal sign-off from the DB team is required before performing the table renaming activity.

Would you like me to format this as an email draft for you to send to the DB team and vendor?
