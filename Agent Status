We observed JVM errors indicating "Retried waiting for GCLocker too often allocating 2950 words."
This points to memory pressure or delays in garbage collection caused by native thread locks.
Itâ€™s likely related to long JNI operations or heap size limitations.
We recommend enabling GC logs and reviewing heap usage for further analysis.
A request has been raised with the vendor for deeper investigation at the JVM level.
