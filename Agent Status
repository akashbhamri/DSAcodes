svc-app-rlct Account Lock Issue Summary

Incident Overview: The svc-app-rlct account got locked due to six incorrect password attempts. Analysis involving both the AD and network teams indicates the source could be any one of over 1,200 IPs, making it challenging to pinpoint the origin. Internal log reviews did not show any of our servers sending incorrect credentials. As a result, preventive measures are now the primary focus to avoid future lockouts.

Timeline & Observations:

Password Reset: Platform team updated the svc-app-rlct account password on 10th January.

Error Start Date: LDAP errors started appearing in logs from 10th January onwards.

Lock Events: Lockouts occurred on 17th, 22nd, and 23rd August.

Log Analysis: All DevOps tool server logs were checked. Only the BB project was found sending incorrect credentials using svc-app-rlct, but this is not the root cause of the issue.


Current Actions:

The Platform Team (Jerrold) is updating the password across all environments where changes were made post-reset.

Everything required from the Monitoring Team has already been shared with the Platform Team.

Detailed Summary: svc-app-rlct Account Lockout & LDAP Error Investigation


---

1. Background: The svc-app-rlct service account has experienced multiple lockouts due to incorrect password attempts, each triggering LDAP error logs. This issue has caused disruptions and required coordination across multiple teams for investigation and resolution.


---

2. Timeline of Events:

January 10th:
The Platform Team updated the password for the svc-app-rlct account as part of a standard reset activity.

Post-January 10th:
After this password update, LDAP-related error logs began appearing, indicating failed authentication attempts from systems still using the old password.

August 17th, 22nd, and 23rd:
The svc-app-rlct account got locked on these three occasions due to six consecutive incorrect login attempts each time.



---

3. Investigation Summary:

Initial Lock Reason:
The account lockouts occurred due to six incorrect password attempts within a short timeframe, as per Active Directory (AD) lockout policies.

Network & AD Logs Review:
Reviewed by both AD and Network teams. It was found that the incorrect attempts are being made from a large IP pool (over 1,200 possible sources), which makes it difficult to identify the exact origin of these login attempts.

Internal Server Log Review:
The Monitoring/DevOps team examined logs across all integrated tools and environments.

Only the BB Project was found still using the old password for the svc-app-rlct account.

However, this is not considered the root cause of the widespread issue, but rather one of the contributing systems.




---

4. Current Status:

Platform Team Actions:
Jerrold and the Platform team are currently identifying and updating the stored credentials across all environments where the password might have been cached or hardcoded after the January reset.

Monitoring Team Actions:
The Monitoring team has completed their part of the investigation:

Collected and analyzed logs from all DevOps tools.

Shared all findings with the Platform team.

Confirmed that there are no monitoring agents or tools causing incorrect login attempts.




---

5. Next Steps:

Platform team to continue validating and updating credentials wherever necessary.

Preventive measures and recommendations are being prioritized to avoid repeated lockouts in the future (e.g., use of secret managers, alerts before reaching lockout threshold, etc.).
