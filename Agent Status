Here's a short description you can use:

"New index 'jenkins' created; request to create a new role with access to this index."

Or slightly more formal:

"As discussed, a new index named 'jenkins' has been created. Please create a new role with appropriate access to this index."

Let me know if you want it tailored for email, ticket, or documentation.
