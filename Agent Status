✅ Final Message (Professional & Complete)

> Hi team,

We have uploaded heap and thread dumps for all the days when the issue occurred. Kindly validate all files and let us know if you notice any issues.

📅 Dump Validation Summary

May 9: Heap dump (~2.89 GB) and all thread dumps are complete and valid.

May 26: Heap dump (~3.3 GB) and thread dumps are healthy.

May 27: Heap dump is only ~103 MB, and several thread dumps are 0 KB in size.
This strongly indicates the heap/thread dump generation was incomplete or failed — likely due to JVM instability, process termination, or insufficient resources during that time.


🔍 Request

1. Please validate the uploaded dumps and confirm if you observe any additional issues.


2. Help us analyze the valid heap dumps (May 9 and May 26) to identify the root cause of high heap memory usage.


3. Share the steps to automate heap and thread dump collection directly on the server, especially during OOM or performance degradation.


4. If there are alternative and more reliable ways to capture these dumps (e.g., JVM options, Prometheus exporters, etc.), please let us know.



Let us know if further inputs are needed from our side.
