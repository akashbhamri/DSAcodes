Subject: Update from Vendor Regarding JDBC Driver Compatibility Issue

Hi Team,

As per the update from the vendor (IBM), their analysis indicates that the issue could be related to a JDBC driver incompatibility with our current Java version.

They have mentioned the following details from their review:

Java Vendor: Oracle Corporation

Java Version: 11.0.27 (11.0.27+8-LTS-232)

Database Driver Name: Oracle JDBC driver

Database Driver Version: 11.2.0.3.0


The vendor has suggested that the current driver version (11.2.0.3.0) is quite old and was originally intended for older Java versions (Java 6/7). This might cause compatibility issues with Java 11.

They have asked us to verify which JDBC driver jar we are using (for example, ojdbc6.jar). Based on the database and Java version, they recommend using an appropriate driver like ojdbc8.jar or ojdbc11.jar, which are compatible with Java 8 and Java 11 respectively.

Meanwhile, the vendor team is continuing to check the logs and heap dumps for further analysis.

Action Required:
We need to check and confirm our current JDBC driver version and evaluate upgrading to a driver version that supports Java 11.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
