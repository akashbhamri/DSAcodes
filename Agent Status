Subject/Heading:
Index Rebuild – DEV Completed, PROD Implementation Planned

Content:
Hi Team,

The index rebuild job has been successfully completed in the DEV environment, and an alert has been configured to notify upon job completion. The index details are also captured as part of the alert notification for monitoring.

We are currently monitoring the DEV environment for a couple of days to ensure everything works as expected. Meanwhile, a change request has been raised for implementing the same activity in the PROD environment.

Please let me know if you need any further details or clarifications.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Role]
