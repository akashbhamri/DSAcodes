Incident Report: UDeploy Production Outage

Date: [Insert Date]

Summary:

On [Insert Date], UDeploy production experienced downtime due to the database’s Fast Recovery Area (FRA) reaching full capacity. This issue was resolved by increasing the FRA size from 100 GB to 200 GB. UDeploy is now operational.

Incident Details:

	•	Initial Discovery: UDeploy stopped responding, and the issue was traced to the database.
	•	Database Investigation: The database team confirmed that the FRA was 100% occupied.
	•	Cause: Both restore points and database transactions were written to the same FRA path. A restore point, created at our request for a UDeploy update activity, was not dropped as it awaited our confirmation.
	•	Immediate Action: Increased FRA size from 100 GB to 200 GB.
	•	Result: UDeploy was brought back online and is functioning as expected.

Root Cause:

The restore point created for the UDeploy update activity was not dropped because we had not confirmed its removal with the database team. This caused the FRA to fill up, preventing database operations.

Resolution:

	•	Increased FRA size from 100 GB to 200 GB.
	•	Verified that UDeploy is functioning correctly after the adjustment.

Action Items:

	1.	Communication: Establish a protocol for confirming the removal of restore points post-update activities.
	2.	Documentation: Create a checklist for update activities, including necessary follow-up actions.

Please let me know if there are any further questions or if additional information is needed.
