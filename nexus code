When discussing the recovery process with the vendor, here are some valid questions to ensure you fully understand and correctly execute the recovery procedure:General Questions:Process Clarification:Can you provide a detailed explanation of each step in the recovery process, including the purpose and expected outcome?Prerequisites:Are there any prerequisites or specific configurations required before starting the recovery process?Task Scheduling:Should we manually schedule or run any maintenance tasks (e.g., Compact Blob Store) after the recovery? If so, how do we configure this?File and Blob Store Management:File Deletion:How does Nexus handle files marked as deleted? Are they retained until manually cleaned up, or is there a default retention period?Blob Store Types:Does the recovery process differ based on the type of blob store (file-based vs. S3)? What should we be aware of for each type?Recovery Specifics:Deletions Index:What should we do if the deletions.index file is missing or corrupted? Is there a way to recreate or repair it?Metadata Restoration:How does the "restore blob metadata" option work in the reconciliation task? Are there any caveats we should be aware of?Script Usage:Can you provide an example script or detailed instructions for marking files as not deleted? Are there any variations based on repository type?Post-Recovery Steps:Validation:How can we validate that the recovery process was successful? Are there specific checks or tests to ensure data integrity?Monitoring:After completing the recovery, are there any recommended monitoring or verification steps to ensure the repository operates correctly?Documentation:Where can we find official documentation or support resources for troubleshooting any issues that arise during the recovery process?Backup and Restoration:Backups:Is it advisable to create a backup of the current blob store and repository before starting the recovery? How can we do this?Restoration Verification:What steps should we take to verify that all files and metadata have been correctly restored and are fully functional?Support and Escalation:Support Channels:What support options are available if we encounter issues during the recovery process? Are there escalation paths for urgent problems?Updates and Patches:Are there any recent updates or patches that might affect the recovery process? Should we ensure that our Nexus installation is up-to-date before starting?These questions will help you gain a thorough understanding of the recovery process and ensure that you’re prepared for any potential issues or complexities.





Questions for the Vendor:Alternative Cleanup Mechanisms:If there's no Compact Blob Store task available, what is the recommended way to ensure that deleted files are permanently removed? Is there an alternative method for cleanup?Task Configuration:Can you confirm if the absence of the Compact Blob Store task affects the recovery process? If not, what specific steps should be followed to manage and clean up deleted files?Manual Cleanup:Is there a manual way to clean up the blob store if the Compact Blob Store task isn’t available? What commands or procedures should be used?Reconciliation and Metadata:Without the Compact Blob Store task, will running the "Repair - Reconcile component database from blob store" task effectively restore the repository? Are there additional steps required?Recovery Validation:What steps should we take to validate the success of the recovery process given that the Compact Blob Store task is not present? Are there specific checks or verification methods recommended?Blob Store Management:Does the absence of the Compact Blob Store task impact blob store performance or management in other ways? How should we handle blob store maintenance and monitoring?Documentation and Support:Can you provide official documentation or guidance on blob store maintenance and recovery processes in scenarios where the Compact Blob Store task is not used?Future Task Creation:If needed, how can we create and schedule a Compact Blob Store task for future maintenance? What is the procedure for setting up this task if required later?
