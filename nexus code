I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we have encountered with our system’s decryption process.

During routine monitoring, we observed that there have been a few decryption failures:

	•	Key: [desedekeyyyyb]
	•	References: 14070
	•	Replaced: 14067
	•	Decryption Failures: 3

These decryption failures are concerning as they could potentially compromise the integrity and security of our data. The failures were identified during the analysis of the key statistics and table operations. Here is a summary of the findings:

	•	Key Replacements: 16511
	•	Decryption Failures: 3
	•	Row Reads: 19827069
	•	Row Updates: 3423325

We have thoroughly reviewed our processes and configurations and have not identified any anomalies on our end that could have caused these decryption failures. As this issue impacts our data security protocols, we are seeking your expertise to identify the root cause and provide a resolution.

Could you please investigate this matter and advise on the following points:

	1.	Potential Causes: What might be causing these decryption failures? Are there any known issues with the current version of the software we are using?
	2.	Logs and Diagnostics: Would you need additional logs or diagnostic information from our side to assist in the investigation?
	3.	Resolution Steps: What steps can we take to prevent these decryption failures in the future? Are there any configuration changes or updates required?
	4.	Impact Assessment: What is the potential impact of these decryption failures on our system’s functionality and data integrity?

We would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter as it is critical to maintain the integrity and security of our data. Please let us know if there are any immediate actions we should take while you investigate this issue.
