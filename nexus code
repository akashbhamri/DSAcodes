Here's a revised version of the content in the description field:

We are planning to perform a uDeploy version upgrade in the production environment. To ensure we have a backup of the current version and files, we need to sync and back up the data. The Unix team is unable to take a VM snapshot due to the large size of the data, which is approximately 9TB. 

Therefore, we need to sync the data and create a backup on the DR server. However, the production server does not have enough space to store the backup, necessitating the backup to be taken directly on the DR server via SSH.

Currently, the rmpci role is restricted to performing actions on the remote server through SSH and does not have write permissions in the target directory. We attempted to use the jkslave account, but it also lacks the necessary write access.

Hence, we require root access to sync the data from the production server to the DR server.
