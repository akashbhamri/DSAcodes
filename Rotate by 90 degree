Hi Kanag,

We’ve been experiencing recurring issues with MFE nodes going down over the past four months. We suspect that this might be related to Java heap size and thread count configurations. Could you please provide guidance on the current Java heap and thread count settings, and suggest any necessary adjustments?

Additionally, our dev server is facing TMP utilization problems due to `jestgbi` and `nexus iq`. We need to:
- Determine if it is safe to delete the TMP files.
- Identify ways to prevent TMP space issues in the future.
- Evaluate whether we need to add more space to the TMP directory as it’s affecting node stability.

Your assistance in resolving these issues would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Hi Team,

In order to proceed with increasing CPU and memory for our MFE nodes, we need to provide the current Java heap size and thread count settings. Could you please confirm these details for our MFE nodes?

Once we have this information, we will coordinate with you to adjust the resources accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
